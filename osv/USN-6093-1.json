  "summary": "linux-bluefield vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the Traffic-Control Index (TCINDEX) implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not properly perform filter deactivation in some\nsituations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated\nprivileges. Please note that with the fix for this CVE, kernel support for\nthe TCINDEX classifier has been removed. (CVE-2023-1829)\n\nIt was discovered that the Traffic-Control Index (TCINDEX) implementation\nin the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-1281)\n\nJiasheng Jiang discovered that the HSA Linux kernel driver for AMD Radeon\nGPU devices did not properly validate memory allocation in certain\nsituations, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2022-3108)\n\nIt was discovered that the infrared transceiver USB driver did not properly\nhandle USB control messages. A local attacker with physical access could\nplug in a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (memory\nexhaustion). (CVE-2022-3903)\n\nHaowei Yan discovered that a race condition existed in the Layer 2\nTunneling Protocol (L2TP) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2022-4129)\n\nJordy Zomer and Alexandra Sandulescu discovered that syscalls invoking the\ndo_prlimit() function in the Linux kernel did not properly handle\nspeculative execution barriers. A local attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-0458)\n\nIt was discovered that the Human Interface Device (HID) support driver in\nthe Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some\nsituations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2023-1073)\n\nIt was discovered that a memory leak existed in the SCTP protocol\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2023-1074)\n\nLianhui Tang discovered that the MPLS implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly handle certain sysctl allocation failure conditions,\nleading to a double-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause\na denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-26545)\n\n",
