(CVE-2019-20637)\n\nIt was discovered that Varnish Cache could have an assertion failure when a\nTLS termination proxy uses PROXY version 2. A remote attacker could possibly\nuse this issue to restart the daemon and cause a performance loss.\n(CVE-2020-11653)\n\nIt was discovered that Varnish Cache allowed request smuggling and VCL\nauthorization bypass via a large Content-Length header for a POST\nrequest. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2021-36740)\n\nIt was discovered that Varnish Cache allowed request smuggling for HTTP/1\nconnections.
