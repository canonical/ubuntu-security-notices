  "details": "It was discovered that an out of bounds read vulnerability existed in the\nassociative array implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2016-7914)\n\nIt was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference existed in the Direct\nRendering Manager (DRM) driver for VMWare devices in the Linux kernel. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2017-7261)\n\nIt was discovered that the USB Cypress HID drivers for the Linux kernel did\nnot properly validate reported information from the device. An attacker\nwith physical access could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel\nmemory). (CVE-2017-7273)\n\nA reference count bug was discovered in the Linux kernel ipx protocol\nstack. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of\nservice or possibly other unspecified problems. (CVE-2017-7487)\n\nHuang Weller discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the\nLinux kernel mishandled a needs-flushing-before-commit list. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-7495)\n\nIt was discovered that an information leak existed in the set_mempolicy and\nmbind compat syscalls in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this\nto expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2017-7616)\n",
