  "description": "A remote Denial of Service vulnerability was discovered in the heimdal\nimplementation of the telnet daemon. A remote attacker could force the\nserver to crash due to a NULL de-reference before the user logged in,\nresulting in inetd turning telnetd off because it forked too fast.\n\nPlease note that the heimdal-servers package is not officially\nsupported in Ubuntu (it is in the 'universe' component of the\narchive). However, this affects you if you use a customized version\nbuilt from the heimdal source package (which is supported).",
