  "description": "\nVasiliy Kulikov discovered that kvm did not correctly clear memory. A local\nattacker could exploit this to read portions of the kernel stack, leading\nto a loss of privacy. (CVE-2010-3881)\n\nTimo Warns discovered that the LDM disk partition handling code did not\ncorrectly handle certain values. By inserting a specially crafted disk\ndevice, a local attacker could exploit this to gain root privileges.\n(CVE-2011-1017)\n\nNeil Horman discovered that NFSv4 did not correctly handle certain orders\nof operation with ACL data. A remote attacker with access to an NFSv4 mount\ncould exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.\n(CVE-2011-1090)\n\nTimo Warns discovered that OSF partition parsing routines did not correctly\nclear memory. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a\nspecially crafted block device to read kernel memory, leading to a loss of\nprivacy. (CVE-2011-1163)\n\nDan Rosenberg discovered that MPT devices did not correctly validate\ncertain values in ioctl calls. If these drivers were loaded, a local\nattacker could exploit this to read arbitrary kernel memory, leading to a\nloss of privacy. (CVE-2011-1494, CVE-2011-1495)\n\nTavis Ormandy discovered that the pidmap function did not correctly handle\nlarge requests. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system,\nleading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1593)\n\nOliver Hartkopp and Dave Jones discovered that the CAN network driver did\nnot correctly validate certain socket structures. If this driver was\nloaded, a local attacker could crash the system, leading to a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2011-1598, CVE-2011-1748)\n\nVasiliy Kulikov discovered that the AGP driver did not check certain ioctl\nvalues. A local attacker with access to the video subsystem could exploit\nthis to crash the system, leading to a denial of service, or possibly gain\nroot privileges. (CVE-2011-1745, CVE-2011-2022)\n\nVasiliy Kulikov discovered that the AGP driver did not check the size of\ncertain memory allocations. A local attacker with access to the video\nsubsystem could exploit this to run the system out of memory, leading to a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2011-1746)\n\nDan Rosenberg reported an error in the old ABI compatibility layer of ARM\nkernels. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of\nservice or gain root privileges. (CVE-2011-1759)\n\nDan Rosenberg discovered that the DCCP stack did not correctly handle\ncertain packet structures. A remote attacker could exploit this to crash\nthe system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1770)\n\nTimo Warns discovered that the EFI GUID partition table was not correctly\nparsed. A physically local attacker that could insert mountable devices\ncould exploit this to crash the system or possibly gain root privileges.\n(CVE-2011-1776)\n\nYogesh Sharma discovered that CIFS did not correctly handle UNCs that had\nno prefixpaths. A local attacker with access to a CIFS partition could\nexploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.\n(CVE-2011-3363)\n",
