  "details": "\nIt was discovered that the BPF verifier in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle internal data structures. A local attacker could use this\nto expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2021-4159)\n\nIt was discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the\nVideo for Linux 2 (V4L2) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-20369)\n\nDuoming Zhou discovered that race conditions existed in the timer handling\nimplementation of the Linux kernel's Rose X.25 protocol layer, resulting in\nuse-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-2318)\n\nRoger Pau Monn\u00e9 discovered that the Xen virtual block driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly initialize memory pages to be used for shared\ncommunication with the backend. A local attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information (guest kernel memory). (CVE-2022-26365)\n\nPawan Kumar Gupta, Alyssa Milburn, Amit Peled, Shani Rehana, Nir Shildan\nand Ariel Sabba discovered that some Intel processors with Enhanced\nIndirect Branch Restricted Speculation (eIBRS) did not properly handle RET\ninstructions after a VM exits. A local attacker could potentially use this\nto expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-26373)\n\nEric Biggers discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the\nio_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3176)\n\nRoger Pau Monn\u00e9 discovered that the Xen paravirtualization frontend in the\nLinux kernel did not properly initialize memory pages to be used for shared\ncommunication with the backend. A local attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information (guest kernel memory). (CVE-2022-33740)\n\nIt was discovered that the Xen paravirtualization frontend in the Linux\nkernel incorrectly shared unrelated data when communicating with certain\nbackends. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(guest crash) or expose sensitive information (guest kernel memory).\n(CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742)\n\nOleksandr Tyshchenko discovered that the Xen paravirtualization platform in\nthe Linux kernel on ARM platforms contained a race condition in certain\nsituations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of\nservice in the host OS. (CVE-2022-33744)\n\nIt was discovered that the Netlink Transformation (XFRM) subsystem in the\nLinux kernel contained a reference counting error. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-36879)\n\n",
