                "description": "It was discovered that containerd insufficiently restricted permissions on container root and plugin directories. If a user or automated system were tricked into launching a specially crafted container image, a remote attacker could traverse directory contents and modify files and execute programs on the host file system, possibly leading to privilege escalation. (CVE-2021-41103)  It was discovered that containerd incorrectly handled file permission changes. If a user or automated system were tricked into launching a specially crafted container image, a remote attacker could change permissions on files on the host file system and possibly escalate privileges. (CVE-2021-32760)  It was discovered that containerd allows attackers to gain access to read- only copies of arbitrary files and directories on the host via a specially- crafted image configuration. An attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2022-23648)  It was discovered that containerd incorrectly handled certain memory operations. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-31030)",
