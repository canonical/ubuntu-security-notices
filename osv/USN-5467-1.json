  "details": "It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly restrict access to\nthe kernel debugger when booted in secure boot environments. A privileged\nattacker could use this to bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.\n(CVE-2022-21499)\n\nAaron Adams discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle the removal of stateful expressions in some situations,\nleading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2022-1966)\n\nIt was discovered that the SCTP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly verify VTAGs in some situations. A remote attacker could\npossibly use this to cause a denial of service (connection disassociation).\n(CVE-2021-3772)\n\nEric Biederman discovered that the cgroup process migration implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not perform permission checks correctly in some\nsituations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain administrative\nprivileges. (CVE-2021-4197)\n\nJann Horn discovered that the FUSE file system in the Linux kernel\ncontained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2022-1011)\n\nQiuhao Li, Gaoning Pan and Yongkang Jia discovered that the KVM\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform guest page\ntable updates in some situations. An attacker in a guest vm could possibly\nuse this to crash the host OS. (CVE-2022-1158)\n\nDuoming Zhou discovered that the 6pack protocol implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not handle detach events properly in some situations, leading to\na use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-1198)\n\nIt was discovered that the PF_KEYv2 implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly initialize kernel memory in some situations. A local attacker\ncould use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2022-1353)\n\nIt was discovered that the implementation of X.25 network protocols in the\nLinux kernel did not terminate link layer sessions properly. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2022-1516)\n\nDemi Marie Obenour and Simon Gaiser discovered that several Xen para-\nvirtualization device frontends did not properly restrict the access rights\nof device backends. An attacker could possibly use a malicious Xen backend\nto gain access to memory pages of a guest VM or cause a denial of service\nin the guest. (CVE-2022-23036, CVE-2022-23037, CVE-2022-23038,\nCVE-2022-23039, CVE-2022-23040, CVE-2022-23041, CVE-2022-23042)\n\nIt was discovered that the USB Gadget file system interface in the Linux\nkernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2022-24958)\n\nIt was discovered that the USB SR9700 ethernet device driver for the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate the length of requests from the device. A\nphysically proximate attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive\ninformation (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-26966)\n\n\u8d75\u5b50\u8f69 discovered that the 802.2 LLC type 2 driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly perform reference counting in some error conditions. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-28356)\n\nIt was discovered that the Microchip CAN BUS Analyzer interface\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error\nconditions, leading to a double-free. A local attacker could possibly use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-28389)\n\nIt was discovered that the EMS CAN/USB interface implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a double-free vulnerability when handling certain\nerror conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2022-28390)\n",
