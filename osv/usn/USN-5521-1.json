If a user or automated system were tricked into launching a\nspecially crafted container image, a remote attacker could change\npermissions on files on the host file system and possibly escalate\nprivileges. (CVE-2021-32760)\n\nIt was discovered that containerd allows attackers to gain access to read-\nonly copies of arbitrary files and directories on the host via a specially-\ncrafted image configuration. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\nobtain sensitive information. (CVE-2022-23648)\n\nIt was discovered that containerd incorrectly handled certain memory\noperations. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2022-31030)\n",
