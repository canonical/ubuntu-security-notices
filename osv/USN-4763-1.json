This issue only\naffected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 20.10. (CVE-2021-25289,\nCVE-2021-25291)\n\nIt was discovered that Pillow incorrectly handled certain Tiff image files.\nIf a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially-crafted\nTiff file, a remote attacker could cause Pillow to crash, resulting in a\ndenial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-25290)\n\nIt was discovered that Pillow incorrectly handled certain PDF files. If a\nuser or automated system were tricked into opening a specially-crafted\nPDF file, a remote attacker could cause Pillow to hang, resulting in a\ndenial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04\nLTS, and Ubuntu 20.10.
