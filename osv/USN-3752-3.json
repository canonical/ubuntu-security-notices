  "summary": "linux-azure, linux-oem, linux-gcp vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that, when attempting to handle an out-of-memory\nsituation, a null pointer dereference could be triggered in the Linux\nkernel in some circumstances. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-1000200)\n\nWen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate meta-data information. An attacker could\nuse this to construct a malicious xfs image that, when mounted, could cause\na denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-10323)\n\nWen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate xattr information. An attacker could use\nthis to construct a malicious xfs image that, when mounted, could cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2018-10840)\n\nWen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly keep meta-data information consistent in some\nsituations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image\nthat, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2018-10881)\n\nWen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle corrupted meta data in some situations. An\nattacker could use this to specially craft an ext4 filesystem that caused a\ndenial of service (system crash) when mounted. (CVE-2018-1093)\n\nJann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel's implementation of random seed\ndata reported that it was in a ready state before it had gathered\nsufficient entropy. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2018-1108)\n\nIt was discovered that the procfs filesystem did not properly handle\nprocesses mapping some memory elements onto files. A local attacker could\nuse this to block utilities that examine the procfs filesystem to report\noperating system state, such as ps(1). (CVE-2018-1120)\n\nJann Horn discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly keep xattr information consistent in some\nsituations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image\nthat, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-11412)\n\nPiotr Gabriel Kosinski and Daniel Shapira discovered a stack-based buffer\noverflow in the CDROM driver implementation of the Linux kernel. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-11506)\n\nShankara Pailoor discovered that a race condition existed in the socket\nhandling code in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause\na denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-12232)\n\nShankara Pailoor discovered that the JFS filesystem implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a buffer overflow when handling extended attributes.\nA local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-12233)\n\nFelix Wilhelm discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly perform permission checks in some situations when nested\nvirtualization is used. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this\nto escape into an outer VM or the host OS. (CVE-2018-12904)\n\nWen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle an error condition with a corrupted xfs\nimage. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious xfs image that,\nwhen mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2018-13094)\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly handle setgid file\ncreation when performed by a non-member of the group. A local attacker\ncould use this to gain elevated privileges. (CVE-2018-13405)\n\nSilvio Cesare discovered that the generic VESA frame buffer driver in the\nLinux kernel contained an integer overflow. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2018-13406)\n\nJakub Jirasek discovered that multiple use-after-free errors existed in the\nUSB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2018-5814)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the ARM Advanced\nMicrocontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) driver in the Linux kernel that\ncould result in a double free. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2018-9415)\n\nIt was discovered that an information leak existed in the generic SCSI\ndriver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2018-1000204)\n",
