  "summary": "openjdk-8, openjdk-lts vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled deserializing Proxy\nclass objects with many interfaces. A remote attacker could possibly use\nthis issue to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a\nspecially crafted input. (CVE-2020-14779)\n\nSergey Ostanin discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly restricted\nauthentication mechanisms. A remote attacker could possibly use this\nissue to obtain sensitive information over an unencrypted connection.\n(CVE-2020-14781)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled untrusted certificates.\nAn attacker could possibly use this issue to read or write sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2020-14782)\n\nZhiqiang Zang discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly checked for integer\noverflows. An attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass certain\nJava sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2020-14792)\n\nMarkus Loewe discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly checked permissions when\nconverting a file system path to an URI. An attacker could possibly use\nthis issue to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2020-14796)\n\nMarkus Loewe discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly checked for invalid\ncharacters when converting an URI to a path. An attacker could possibly\nuse this issue to read or write sensitive information. (CVE-2020-14797)\n\nMarkus Loewe discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly checked the length of\ninput strings. An attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass certain\nJava sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2020-14798)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled boundary checks. An\nattacker could possibly use this issue to bypass certain Java sandbox\nrestrictions. (CVE-2020-14803)\n",
