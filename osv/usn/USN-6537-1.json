  "details": "Yu Hao discovered that the UBI driver in the Linux kernel did not properly\ncheck for MTD with zero erasesize during device attachment. A local\nprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2023-31085)\n\nLucas Leong discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly validate some attributes passed from userspace. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-39189)\n\nBien Pham discovered that the netfiler subsystem in the Linux kernel\ncontained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nlocal user could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-4244)\n\nKyle Zeng discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle socket buffers (skb) when performing IP routing in\ncertain circumstances, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability.\nA privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2023-42754)\n\nYikebaer Aizezi discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability when handling inode\nextent metadata. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4\nfile system image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2023-45898)\n\nMaxim Levitsky discovered that the KVM nested virtualization (SVM)\nimplementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel did not properly\nhandle x2AVIC MSRs. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (host kernel crash). (CVE-2023-5090)\n\nJason Wang discovered that the virtio ring implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle iov buffers in some situations. A local\nattacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (host\nsystem crash). (CVE-2023-5158)\n\nAlon Zahavi discovered that the NVMe-oF/TCP subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly handle queue initialization failures in certain\nsituations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A remote attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-5178)\n\nIt was discovered that the SMB network file sharing protocol implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions,\nleading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2023-5345)\n\nMurray McAllister discovered that the VMware Virtual GPU DRM driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle memory objects when storing surfaces,\nleading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker in a guest VM\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-5633)\n\nBudimir Markovic discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle event groups, leading to an out-of-bounds write\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-5717)\n\n",
