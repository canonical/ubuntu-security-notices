  "details": "It was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled malformed EC private key\nfiles. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service, or execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2015-0209)\n\nStephen Henson discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled comparing ASN.1\nboolean types. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause\nOpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0286)\n\nEmilia K\u00e4sper discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled ASN.1 structure\nreuse. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service, or execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2015-0287)\n\nBrian Carpenter discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled invalid\ncertificate keys. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause\nOpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0288)\n\nMichal Zalewski discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled missing outer\nContentInfo when parsing PKCS#7 structures. A remote attacker could\npossibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of\nservice, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-0289)\n\nRobert Dugal and David Ramos discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled\ndecoding Base64 encoded data. A remote attacker could possibly use this\nissue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-0292)\n\nSean Burford and Emilia K\u00e4sper discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled\nspecially crafted SSLv2 CLIENT-MASTER-KEY messages. A remote attacker could\npossibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2015-0293)\n",
