This update provides the\ncorresponding updates for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu\n23.04.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that YAJL was not properly performing bounds checks when\n decoding a string with escape sequences. If a user or automated system\n using YAJL were tricked into processing specially crafted input, an\n attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service\n (application abort). (CVE-2017-16516)\n \n It was discovered that YAJL was not properly handling memory allocation\n when dealing with large inputs, which could lead to heap memory\n corruption. If a user or automated system using YAJL were tricked into\n running a specially crafted large input, an attacker could possibly use\n this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-24795)\n \n It was discovered that memory leaks existed in one of the YAJL parsing\n functions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of\n service (memory exhaustion).
