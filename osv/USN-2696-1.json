  "details": "Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the OpenJDK JRE related to\ninformation disclosure, data integrity, and availability. An attacker\ncould exploit these to cause a denial of service or expose sensitive\ndata over the network. (CVE-2015-2590, CVE-2015-2628, CVE-2015-4731,\nCVE-2015-4732, CVE-2015-4733, CVE-2015-4760, CVE-2015-4748)\n\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in the cryptographic components\nof the OpenJDK JRE. An attacker could exploit these to expose sensitive\ndata over the network. (CVE-2015-2601, CVE-2015-2808, CVE-2015-4000,\nCVE-2015-2625, CVE-2015-2613)\n\nAs a security improvement, this update modifies OpenJDK behavior to\ndisable RC4 TLS/SSL cipher suites by default.\n\nAs a security improvement, this update modifies OpenJDK behavior to\nreject DH key sizes below 768 bits by default, preventing a possible\ndowngrade attack.\n\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in the OpenJDK JRE related\nto information disclosure. An attacker could exploit these to expose\nsensitive data over the network. (CVE-2015-2621, CVE-2015-2632)\n\nA vulnerability was discovered with how the JNDI component of the\nOpenJDK JRE handles DNS resolutions. A remote attacker could exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2015-4749)\n",
