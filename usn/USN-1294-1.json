  "description": "\nPeter Huewe discovered an information leak in the handling of reading\nsecurity-related TPM data. A local, unprivileged user could read the\nresults of a previous TPM command. (CVE-2011-1162)\n\nVasiliy Kulikov discovered that taskstats did not enforce access\nrestrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain\ninformation, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2494)\n\nQianfeng Zhang discovered that the bridge networking interface incorrectly\nhandled certain network packets. A remote attacker could exploit this to\ncrash the system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2942)\n\nYasuaki Ishimatsu discovered a flaw in the kernel's clock implementation. A\nlocal unprivileged attacker could exploit this causing a denial of service.\n(CVE-2011-3209)\n\nZheng Liu discovered a flaw in how the ext4 filesystem splits extents. A\nlocal unprivileged attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading\nto a denial of service. (CVE-2011-3638)\n\nScot Doyle discovered that the bridge networking interface incorrectly\nhandled certain network packets. A remote attacker could exploit this to\ncrash the system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-4087)\n\nA bug was found in the way headroom check was performed in\nudp6_ufo_fragment() function. A remote attacker could use this flaw to\ncrash the system. (CVE-2011-4326)\n",
