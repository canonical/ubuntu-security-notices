  "summary": "linux, linux-aws, linux-kvm, linux-raspi2, linux-snapdragon vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ARC EMAC ethernet\ndriver for the Linux kernel, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.\nAn attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2016-10906)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Serial Attached SCSI\n(SAS) implementation in the Linux kernel when handling certain error\nconditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(kernel deadlock). (CVE-2017-18232)\n\nIt was discovered that the RSI 91x Wi-Fi driver in the Linux kernel did not\ndid not handle detach operations correctly, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2018-21008)\n\nWen Huang discovered that the Marvell Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly perform bounds checking, leading to a heap\noverflow. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-14814,\nCVE-2019-14816)\n\nMatt Delco discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly perform bounds checking when handling coalesced\nMMIO write operations. A local attacker with write access to /dev/kvm could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-14821)\n\nHui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB audio driver for the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate device meta data. A physically\nproximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2019-15117)\n\nHui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB audio driver for the\nLinux kernel improperly performed recursion while handling device meta\ndata. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2019-15118)\n\nIt was discovered that the Technisat DVB-S/S2 USB device driver in the\nLinux kernel contained a buffer overread. A physically proximate attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexpose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-15505)\n\nBrad Spengler discovered that a Spectre mitigation was improperly\nimplemented in the ptrace susbsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker\ncould possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-15902)\n\n",
