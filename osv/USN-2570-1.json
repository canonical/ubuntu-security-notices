  "details": "An issue was discovered in the HTML parser in Blink. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions.\n(CVE-2015-1235)\n\nAn issue was discovered in the Web Audio API implementation in Blink. If\na user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker\ncould potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions.\n(CVE-2015-1236)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1237)\n\nAn out-of-bounds write was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in\nto opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\nexploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.\n(CVE-2015-1238)\n\nAn out-of-bounds read was discovered in the WebGL implementation. If a\nuser were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker\ncould potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer\ncrash. (CVE-2015-1240)\n\nAn issue was discovered with the interaction of page navigation and touch\nevent handling. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\nwebsite, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct\n\"tap jacking\" attacks. (CVE-2015-1241)\n\nA type confusion bug was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1242)\n\nIt was discovered that websocket connections were not upgraded whenever a\nHSTS policy is active. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this\nto conduct a machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. (CVE-2015-1244)\n\nAn out-of-bounds read was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in\nto opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\nexploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash.\n(CVE-2015-1246)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial\nof service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1249)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in the file picker implementation. If a\nuser were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker\ncould potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via\napplication crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nuser invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1321)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked\nin to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\nexploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via\nrenderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nsandboxed render process.
