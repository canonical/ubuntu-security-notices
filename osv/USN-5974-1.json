  "details": "It was discovered that GraphicsMagick was not properly performing bounds\nchecks when processing TGA image files, which could lead to a heap buffer\noverflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a\nspecially crafted TGA image file, an attacker could possibly use this\nissue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. This issue\nonly affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM and Ubuntu 16.04 ESM. (CVE-2018-20184)\n\nIt was discovered that GraphicsMagick was not properly validating bits per\npixel data when processing DIB image files. If a user or automated system\nwere tricked into processing a specially crafted DIB image file, an\nattacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This\nissue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM and Ubuntu 16.04 ESM.\n(CVE-2018-20189)\n\nIt was discovered that GraphicsMagick was not properly processing\nbit-field mask values in BMP image files, which could result in the\nexecution of an infinite loop. If a user or automated system were tricked\ninto processing a specially crafted BMP image file, an attacker could\npossibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only\naffected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM and Ubuntu 16.04 ESM. (CVE-2018-5685)\n\nIt was discovered that GraphicsMagick was not properly validating data\nused in arithmetic operations when processing MNG image files, which\ncould result in a divide-by-zero error. If a user or automated system were\ntricked into processing a specially crafted MNG image file, an attacker\ncould possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue\nonly affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM and Ubuntu 16.04 ESM. (CVE-2018-9018)\n\nIt was discovered that GraphicsMagick was not properly performing bounds\nchecks when processing MIFF image files, which could lead to a heap buffer\noverflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a\nspecially crafted MIFF image file, an attacker could possibly use this\nissue to cause a denial of service or expose sensitive information. This\nissue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM and Ubuntu 16.04 ESM.\n(CVE-2019-11006)\n\nIt was discovered that GraphicsMagick did not properly magnify certain\nMNG image files, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow. If a user or\nautomated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted MNG\nimage file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial\nof service or execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu\n20.04 LTS. (CVE-2020-12672)\n\nIt was discovered that GraphicsMagick was not properly performing bounds\nchecks when parsing certain MIFF image files, which could lead to a heap\nbuffer overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into\nprocessing a specially crafted MIFF image file, an attacker could possibly\nuse this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2022-1270)\n",
