  "details": "Marek Marczykowski-G\u00f3recki discovered that the Xen event channel\ninfrastructure implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race\ncondition. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a\ndenial of service (paravirtualized device unavailability). (CVE-2023-34324)\n\nZheng Wang discovered a use-after-free in the Renesas Ethernet AVB driver\nin the Linux kernel during device removal. A privileged attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-35827)\n\nTom Dohrmann discovered that the Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV)\nimplementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel contained a race\ncondition when accessing MMIO registers. A local attacker in a SEV guest VM\ncould possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-46813)\n\nIt was discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel contained\na race condition, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-46862)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the ATM (Asynchronous\nTransfer Mode) subsystem of the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-51780)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the AppleTalk networking\nsubsystem of the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-51781)\n\nIt was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly validate inner tunnel netlink attributes, leading to a null\npointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause\na denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-5972)\n\nIt was discovered that the TLS subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly perform cryptographic operations in some situations, leading to a\nnull pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2023-6176)\n\nJann Horn discovered that a race condition existed in the Linux kernel when\nhandling io_uring over sockets, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.\nA local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-6531)\n\nXingyuan Mo discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle dynset expressions passed from userspace, leading to a\nnull pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-6622)\n\nZhenghan Wang discovered that the generic ID allocator implementation in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly check for null bitmap when releasing IDs.\nA local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2023-6915)\n\nRobert Morris discovered that the CIFS network file system implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not properly validate certain server commands\nfields, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. An attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2024-0565)\n\nJann Horn discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle the release of certain buffer rings. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-0582)\n\nIt was discovered that the TIPC protocol implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly handle locking during tipc_crypto_key_revoke() operations.\nA local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel\ndeadlock). (CVE-2024-0641)\n\nJann Horn discovered that the TLS subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle spliced messages, leading to an out-of-bounds write\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-0646)\n\n",
