  "description": "Marc Stern discovered a buffer overflow in the SSL module's\ncertificate revocation list (CRL) handler. If Apache is configured to\nuse a malicious CRL, this could possibly lead to a server crash or\narbitrary code execution with the privileges of the Apache web server.\n(CAN-2005-1268)\n\nWatchfire discovered that Apache insufficiently verified the\n\"Transfer-Encoding\" and \"Content-Length\" headers when acting as an\nHTTP proxy. By sending a specially crafted HTTP request, a remote\nattacker who is authorized to use the proxy could exploit this to\nbypass web application firewalls, poison the HTTP proxy cache, and\nconduct cross-site scripting attacks against other proxy users.\n(CAN-2005-2088)",
