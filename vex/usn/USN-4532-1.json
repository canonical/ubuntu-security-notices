By sending an HTTP header with whitespace before the colon, a remote  attacker could possibly use this issue to perform an HTTP request  smuggling attack. (CVE-2019-16869)  It was discovered that Netty incorrectly handled certain HTTP headers.  By sending an HTTP header that lacks a colon, a remote attacker could  possibly use this issue to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack. (CVE-2019-20444)  It was discovered that Netty incorrectly handled certain HTTP headers.  By sending a Content-Length header accompanied by a second Content-Length  header, or by a Transfer-Encoding header, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack.
