If a user were tricked in to opening a\n specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\n obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service via application\n crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking\n Firefox. (CVE-2015-4475)\n \n A use-after-free was discovered during MediaStream playback in some\n circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\n website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of\n service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the\n priviliges of the user invoking Firefox.

If a user were tricked in to\n opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\n exploit these, in combination with another security vulnerability, to\n cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary\n code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-4487,\n CVE-2015-4488, CVE-2015-4489)\n \n Christoph Kerschbaumer discovered an issue with Mozilla's implementation\n of Content Security Policy (CSP), which could allow for a more permissive\n usage in some cirucumstances.

If a user were\n tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\n potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application\n crash or execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the user invoking\n Firefox. (CVE-2015-4491)\n \n Looben Yang discovered a use-after-free when using XMLHttpRequest with\n shared workers in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening\n a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\n cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code\n with the priviliges of the user invoking Firefox.
