  "summary": "grub2, grub2-signed vulnerabilities",
  "details": "Jesse Michael and Mickey Shkatov discovered that the configuration parser\nin GRUB2 did not properly exit when errors were discovered, resulting in\nheap-based buffer overflows. A local attacker could use this to execute\narbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. (CVE-2020-10713)\n\nChris Coulson discovered that the GRUB2 function handling code did not\nproperly handle a function being redefined, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code\nand bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. (CVE-2020-15706)\n\nChris Coulson discovered that multiple integer overflows existed in GRUB2\nwhen handling certain filesystems or font files, leading to heap-based\nbuffer overflows. A local attacker could use these to execute arbitrary\ncode and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. (CVE-2020-14309,\nCVE-2020-14310, CVE-2020-14311)\n\nIt was discovered that the memory allocator for GRUB2 did not validate\nallocation size, resulting in multiple integer overflows and heap-based\nbuffer overflows when handling certain filesystems, PNG images or disk\nmetadata. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code and\nbypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. (CVE-2020-14308)\n\nMathieu Trudel-Lapierre discovered that in certain situations, GRUB2\nfailed to validate kernel signatures. A local attacker could use this\nto bypass Secure Boot restrictions. (CVE-2020-15705)\n\nColin Watson and Chris Coulson discovered that an integer overflow\nexisted in GRUB2 when handling the initrd command, leading to a heap-based\nbuffer overflow. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code\nand bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. (CVE-2020-15707)\n",
