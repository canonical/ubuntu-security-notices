  "details": "USN-3930-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.10.\nThis update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware\nEnablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 18.10 for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.\n\nMathias Payer and Hui Peng discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the\nAdvanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem. A physically proximate\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2018-19824)\n\nShlomi Oberman, Yuli Shapiro, and Ran Menscher discovered an information\nleak in the Bluetooth implementation of the Linux kernel. An attacker\nwithin Bluetooth range could use this to expose sensitive information\n(kernel memory). (CVE-2019-3459, CVE-2019-3460)\n\nJann Horn discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel\ncontained a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker in a guest VM with\naccess to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of service (guest VM\ncrash). (CVE-2019-6974)\n\nJim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in\nthe KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, when using nested virtual machines.\nA local attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code in the host system.\n(CVE-2019-7221)\n\nFelix Wilhelm discovered that an information leak vulnerability existed in\nthe KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, when nested virtualization is used.\nA local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (host\nsystem memory to a guest VM). (CVE-2019-7222)\n\nJann Horn discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel was\ninsufficiently hardened against Spectre V1 attacks. A local attacker could\nuse this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-7308)\n\nIt was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the user-\nspace API for crypto (af_alg) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-8912)\n\nJakub Jirasek discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the SCTP\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2019-8956)\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory\nwhen handling certain errors while reading files. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (excessive memory consumption).\n(CVE-2019-8980)\n\nIt was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the IPMI\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker with access to the\nIPMI character device files could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2019-9003)\n\nJann Horn discovered that the SNMP NAT implementation in the Linux kernel\nperformed insufficient ASN.1 length checks. An attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2019-9162)\n\nJann Horn discovered that the mmap implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly check for the mmap minimum address in some situations. A local\nattacker could use this to assist exploiting a kernel NULL pointer\ndereference vulnerability. (CVE-2019-9213)\n",
