A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-0461)  It was discovered that the System V IPC implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle large shared memory counts. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-3669)  It was discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the Video for Linux 2 (V4L2) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-20369)  Pawan Kumar Gupta, Alyssa Milburn, Amit Peled, Shani Rehana, Nir Shildan and Ariel Sabba discovered that some Intel processors with Enhanced Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (eIBRS) did not properly handle RET instructions after a VM exits. A local attacker could potentially use this to expose sensitive information.

(CVE-2022-2663)  Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi discovered that for some AMD x86-64 processors, the branch predictor could by mis-trained for return instructions in certain circumstances. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-29900)  Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi discovered that for some Intel x86-64 processors, the Linux kernel's protections against speculative branch target injection attacks were insufficient in some circumstances. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-29901)  It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the SGI GRU driver in the Linux kernel.

An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2022-3646)  Khalid Masum discovered that the NILFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.
