                "description": "It was discovered that some 3rd and 4th Generation Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae Processors did not properly restrict access to certain hardware features when using Intel\u00ae SGX or Intel\u00ae TDX. This may allow a privileged local user to potentially further escalate their privileges on the system. This issue only affected Ubuntu 23.10, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2023-22655)  It was discovered that some Intel\u00ae Atom\u00ae Processors did not properly clear register state when performing various operations. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive information via a transient execution attack. This issue only affected Ubuntu 23.10, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2023-28746)  It was discovered that some Intel\u00ae Processors did not properly clear the state of various hardware structures when switching execution contexts. A local attacker could use this to access privileged information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 23.10, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2023-38575)  It was discovered that some Intel\u00ae Processors did not properly enforce bus lock regulator protections. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 23.10, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2023-39368)  It was discovered that some Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae D Processors did not properly calculate the SGX base key when using Intel\u00ae SGX. A privileged local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 23.10, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2023-43490)  It was discovered that some Intel\u00ae Processors did not properly protect against concurrent accesses. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2023-45733)  It was discovered that some Intel\u00ae Processors TDX module software did not properly validate input. A privileged local attacker could use this information to potentially further escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2023-45745, CVE-2023-47855)  It was discovered that some Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 Ultra processors did not properly handle particular instruction sequences. A local attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2023-46103)",
