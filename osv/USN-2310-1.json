  "details": "It was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled certain crafted Draft 9\nrequests. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the daemon to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu\n12.04 LTS. (CVE-2012-1016)\n\nIt was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled certain malformed\nKRB5_PADATA_PK_AS_REQ AS-REQ requests. A remote attacker could use this\nissue to cause the daemon to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This\nissue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. (CVE-2013-1415)\n\nIt was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled certain crafted TGS-REQ\nrequests. A remote authenticated attacker could use this issue to cause the\ndaemon to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected\nUbuntu 10.04 LTS and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. (CVE-2013-1416)\n\nIt was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled certain crafted\nrequests when multiple realms were configured. A remote attacker could use\nthis issue to cause the daemon to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\nThis issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\n(CVE-2013-1418, CVE-2013-6800)\n\nIt was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled certain invalid tokens.\nIf a remote attacker were able to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack, this\nflaw could be used to cause the daemon to crash, resulting in a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2014-4341, CVE-2014-4342)\n\nIt was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled certain mechanisms when\nused with SPNEGO. If a remote attacker were able to perform a\nmachine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be used to cause clients to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2014-4343)\n\nIt was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled certain continuation\ntokens during SPNEGO negotiations. A remote attacker could use this issue\nto cause the daemon to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n(CVE-2014-4344)\n\nTomas Kuthan and Greg Hudson discovered that the Kerberos kadmind daemon\nincorrectly handled buffers when used with the LDAP backend. A remote\nattacker could use this issue to cause the daemon to crash, resulting in a\ndenial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-4345)\n",
