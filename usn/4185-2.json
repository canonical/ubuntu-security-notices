A local attacker\ncould use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-11135)\n\nDeepak Gupta discovered that on certain Intel processors, the Linux kernel\ndid not properly perform invalidation on page table updates by virtual\nguest operating systems. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to\ncause a denial of service (host system crash). (CVE-2018-12207)\n\nOri Nimron discovered that the AX25 network protocol implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks. A local attacker\ncould use this to create a raw socket. (CVE-2019-17052)\n\nOri Nimron discovered that the IEEE 802.15.4 Low-Rate Wireless network\nprotocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform\npermissions checks. A local attacker could use this to create a raw socket.\n(CVE-2019-17053)\n\nOri Nimron discovered that the Appletalk network protocol implementation in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks. A local\nattacker could use this to create a raw socket. (CVE-2019-17054)\n\nOri Nimron discovered that the modular ISDN network protocol implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks. A local\nattacker could use this to create a raw socket. (CVE-2019-17055)\n\nOri Nimron discovered that the Near field Communication (NFC) network\nprotocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform\npermissions checks. A local attacker could use this to create a raw socket.\n(CVE-2019-17056)\n",
