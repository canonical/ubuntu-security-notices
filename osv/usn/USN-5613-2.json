  "details": "USN-5613-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Vim. Unfortunately that update failed\nto include binary packages for some architectures. This update fixes that\nregression.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that Vim was not properly performing bounds checks\n when executing spell suggestion commands. An attacker could possibly use\n this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.\n (CVE-2022-0943)\n \n It was discovered that Vim was using freed memory when dealing with\n regular expressions through its old regular expression engine. If a user\n were tricked into opening a specially crafted file, an attacker could\n crash the application, leading to a denial of service, or possibly achieve\n code execution. (CVE-2022-1154)\n \n It was discovered that Vim was not properly performing checks on name of\n lambda functions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a\n denial of service. This issue affected only Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.\n (CVE-2022-1420)\n \n It was discovered that Vim was incorrectly performing bounds checks\n when processing invalid commands with composing characters in Ex\n mode. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of\n service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1616)\n \n It was discovered that Vim was not properly processing latin1 data\n when issuing Ex commands. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\n cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1619)\n \n It was discovered that Vim was not properly performing memory\n management when dealing with invalid regular expression patterns in\n buffers. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of\n service. (CVE-2022-1620)\n \n It was discovered that Vim was not properly processing invalid bytes\n when performing spell check operations. An attacker could possibly use\n this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.\n (CVE-2022-1621)\n",
