  "details": "Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the Linux kernel did not\nsufficiently randomize IP ID values generated for connectionless networking\nprotocols. A remote attacker could use this to track particular Linux\ndevices. (CVE-2019-10638)\n\nPraveen Pandey discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly validate\nsent signals in some situations on PowerPC systems with transactional\nmemory disabled. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2019-13648)\n\nIt was discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly validate meta data, leading to a buffer overread. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2019-14283)\n\nIt was discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly validate ioctl() calls, leading to a division-by-zero. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2019-14284)\n\nJason Wang discovered that an infinite loop vulnerability existed in the\nvirtio net driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker in a guest VM could\npossibly use this to cause a denial of service in the host system.\n(CVE-2019-3900)\n",
