  "details": "USN-5092-2 fixed vulnerabilities in Linux 5.11-based kernels.\nUnfortunately, for Linux kernels intended for use within Microsoft\nAzure environments, that update introduced a regression that could\ncause the kernel to fail to boot in large Azure instance types.\nThis update fixes the problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\nValentina Palmiotti discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux\nkernel could be coerced to free adjacent memory. A local attacker could use\nthis to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-41073)\n\nOfek Kirzner, Adam Morrison, Benedict Schlueter, and Piotr Krysiuk\ndiscovered that the BPF verifier in the Linux kernel missed possible\nmispredicted branches due to type confusion, allowing a side-channel\nattack. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2021-33624)\n\nBenedict Schlueter discovered that the BPF subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly protect against Speculative Store Bypass (SSB) side-\nchannel attacks in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use\nthis to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-34556)\n\nPiotr Krysiuk discovered that the BPF subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly protect against Speculative Store Bypass (SSB) side-channel\nattacks in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to\nexpose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-35477)\n\nIt was discovered that the tracing subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly keep track of per-cpu ring buffer state. A privileged attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2021-3679)\n\nIt was discovered that the Option USB High Speed Mobile device driver in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly handle error conditions. A physically\nproximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-37159)\n\nAlexey Kardashevskiy discovered that the KVM implementation for PowerPC\nsystems in the Linux kernel did not properly validate RTAS arguments in\nsome situations. An attacker in a guest vm could use this to cause a denial\nof service (host OS crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2021-37576)\n\nIt was discovered that the Virtio console implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate input lengths in some situations. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2021-38160)\n\nMichael Wakabayashi discovered that the NFSv4 client implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly order connection setup operations. An\nattacker controlling a remote NFS server could use this to cause a denial\nof service on the client. (CVE-2021-38199)\n\nIt was discovered that the Sun RPC implementation in the Linux kernel\ncontained an out-of-bounds access error. A remote attacker could possibly\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-38201)\n\nIt was discovered that the MAX-3421 host USB device driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle device removal events. A physically\nproximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2021-38204)\n\nIt was discovered that the Xilinx 10/100 Ethernet Lite device driver in the\nLinux kernel could report pointer addresses in some situations. An attacker\ncould use this information to ease the exploitation of another\nvulnerability. (CVE-2021-38205)\n",
