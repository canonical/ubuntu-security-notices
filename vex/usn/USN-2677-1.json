If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2015-1270)  A use-after-free was discovered in the GPU process implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1272)  A use-after-free was discovered in the IndexedDB implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1276)  A use-after-free was discovered in the accessibility implemetation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1277)  A memory corruption issue was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1280)  It was discovered that Blink did not properly determine the V8 context of a microtask in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions. (CVE-2015-1281)  Multiple integer overflows were discovered in Expat.
