  "description": "Chris Moore discovered a buffer overflow in a particular class of\nlexicographical scanners generated by flex. This could be exploited to\nexecute arbitrary code by processing specially crafted user-defined\ninput to an application that uses a flex scanner for parsing.\n\nThis flaw particularly affects gpc, the GNU Pascal Compiler. A\npotentially remote attacker could exploit this by tricking an user or\nautomated system into compiling a specially crafted Pascal source code\nfile.\n\nPlease note that gpc is not officially supported in Ubuntu (it is in\nthe 'universe' component of the archive). However, this affects you if\nyou use a customized version built from the gcc-3.3 or gcc-3.4 source\npackage (which is supported).",
