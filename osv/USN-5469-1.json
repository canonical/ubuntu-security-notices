  "details": "It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly restrict access to\nthe kernel debugger when booted in secure boot environments. A privileged\nattacker could use this to bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.\n(CVE-2022-21499)\n\nAaron Adams discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle the removal of stateful expressions in some situations,\nleading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2022-1966)\n\nBilly Jheng Bing Jhong discovered that the CIFS network file system\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate arguments to\nioctl() in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-0168)\n\nHu Jiahui discovered that multiple race conditions existed in the Advanced\nLinux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework, leading to use-after-free\nvulnerabilities. A local attacker could use these to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1048)\n\nQiuhao Li, Gaoning Pan and Yongkang Jia discovered that the KVM\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform guest page\ntable updates in some situations. An attacker in a guest vm could possibly\nuse this to crash the host OS. (CVE-2022-1158)\n\nIt was discovered that the implementation of the 6pack and mkiss protocols\nin the Linux kernel did not handle detach events properly in some\nsituations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker\ncould possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2022-1195)\n\nDuoming Zhou discovered that the 6pack protocol implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not handle detach events properly in some situations, leading to\na use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-1198)\n\nDuoming Zhou discovered that the AX.25 amateur radio protocol\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not handle detach events properly in\nsome situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1199)\n\nDuoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the AX.25 amateur radio protocol\nimplementation in the Linux kernel during device detach operations. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2022-1204)\n\nDuoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the AX.25 amateur radio protocol\nimplementation in the Linux kernel, leading to use-after-free\nvulnerabilities. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash). (CVE-2022-1205)\n\nQiuhao Li, Gaoning Pan, and Yongkang Jia discovered that the kvm\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not handle releasing a virtual cpu\nproperly. A local attacker in a guest VM coud possibly use this to cause a\ndenial of service (host system crash). (CVE-2022-1263)\n\nIt was discovered that the PF_KEYv2 implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly initialize kernel memory in some situations. A local attacker\ncould use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2022-1353)\n\nIt was discovered that the implementation of X.25 network protocols in the\nLinux kernel did not terminate link layer sessions properly. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2022-1516)\n\nIt was discovered that the ACRN Hypervisor Service Module implementation in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A\nlocal privileged attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of\nservice (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2022-1651)\n\nIt was discovered that the RxRPC session socket implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle ioctls called when no security protocol is\ngiven. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2022-1671)\n\nZiming Zhang discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate sets with multiple ranged fields. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2022-1972)\n\n\u8d75\u5b50\u8f69 discovered that the 802.2 LLC type 2 driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly perform reference counting in some error conditions. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-28356)\n\nIt was discovered that the 8 Devices USB2CAN interface implementation in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading\nto a double-free. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-28388)\n\nIt was discovered that the Microchip CAN BUS Analyzer interface\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error\nconditions, leading to a double-free. A local attacker could possibly use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-28389)\n\nIt was discovered that the EMS CAN/USB interface implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a double-free vulnerability when handling certain\nerror conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2022-28390)\n",
