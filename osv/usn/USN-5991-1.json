  "summary": "linux-gcp-4.15 vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the System V IPC implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly handle large shared memory counts. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-3669)\n\nIt was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the SGI\nGRU driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2022-3424)\n\nZiming Zhang discovered that the VMware Virtual GPU DRM driver in the Linux\nkernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2022-36280)\n\nHyunwoo Kim discovered that the DVB Core driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-\nafter-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2022-41218)\n\nIt was discovered that the network queuing discipline implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a null pointer dereference in some situations. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2022-47929)\n\nJos\u00e9 Oliveira and Rodrigo Branco discovered that the prctl syscall\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not properly protect against\nindirect branch prediction attacks in some situations. A local attacker\ncould possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-0045)\n\nIt was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the\nAdvanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-0266)\n\nKyle Zeng discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel\ncontained a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in certain situations. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-0394)\n\nKyle Zeng discovered that the ATM VC queuing discipline implementation in\nthe Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some\nsituations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2023-23455)\n\nIt was discovered that the RNDIS USB driver in the Linux kernel contained\nan integer overflow vulnerability. A local attacker with physical access\ncould plug in a malicious USB device to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-23559)\n\nWei Chen discovered that the DVB USB AZ6027 driver in the Linux kernel\ncontained a null pointer dereference when handling certain messages from\nuser space. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2023-28328)\n\n",
