A local authenticated user could potentially use this to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2023-42667)  It was discovered that some Intel\u00ae Processors did not properly isolate the stream cache. A local authenticated user could potentially use this to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2023-49141)  It was discovered that some Intel\u00ae Processors did not correctly transition between the executive monitor and SMI transfer monitor (STM). A privileged local attacker could use this to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2024-24853)  It was discovered that some 3rd, 4th, and 5th Generation Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae Processors failed to properly implement a protection mechanism. A local attacker could use this to potentially escalate their privileges. (CVE-2024-24980)  It was discovered that some 3rd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors did not properly handle mirrored regions with different values. A privileged local user could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2024-25939)",
