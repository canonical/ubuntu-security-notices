  "details": "It was discovered that a null pointer dereference vulnerability existed in\nthe DCCP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-1130)\n\nJann Horn discovered that the 32 bit adjtimex() syscall implementation for\n64 bit Linux kernels did not properly initialize memory returned to user\nspace in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2018-11508)\n\nWang Qize discovered that an information disclosure vulnerability existed\nin the SMBus driver for ACPI Embedded Controllers in the Linux kernel. A\nlocal attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel\npointer addresses). (CVE-2018-5750)\n\nIt was discovered that the SCTP Protocol implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate userspace provided payload lengths in some\nsituations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2018-5803)\n\nIt was discovered that an integer overflow error existed in the futex\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-6927)\n\nIt was discovered that an information leak vulnerability existed in the\nfloppy driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\nexpose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2018-7755)\n\nIt was discovered that a memory leak existed in the SAS driver subsystem of\nthe Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2018-7757)\n",
