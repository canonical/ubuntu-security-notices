  "description": "Imran Ghory discovered a race condition in the file permission restore\ncode of bunzip2. While a user was decompressing a file, a local\nattacker with write permissions in the directory of that file could\nreplace the target file with a hard link. This would cause bzip2 to\nrestore the file permissions to the hard link target instead of to the\nbzip2 output file, which could be exploited to gain read or even write\naccess to files of other users. (CAN-2005-0953)\n\nSpecially crafted bzip2 archives caused an infinite loop in the\ndecompressor which resulted in an indefinitively large output file\n(\"decompression bomb\"). This could be exploited to a Denial of Service\nattack due to disk space exhaustion on systems which automatically\nprocess user supplied bzip2 compressed files. (CAN-2005-1260)",
