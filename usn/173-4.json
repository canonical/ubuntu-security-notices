  "description": "USN-173-1 fixed a buffer overflow vulnerability in the PCRE library.\nHowever, it was found that the various python packages and gnumeric\ncontain static copies of the library code, so these packages need to\nbe updated as well.\n\nIn gnumeric this bug could be exploited to execute arbitrary code with\nthe privileges of the user if the user was tricked into opening a\nspecially crafted spreadsheet document.\n\nIn python, the impact depends on the particular application that uses\npython's \"re\" (regular expression) module. In python server\napplications that process unchecked arbitrary regular expressions with\nthe \"re\" module, this could potentially be exploited to remotely\nexecute arbitrary code with the privileges of the server.",
