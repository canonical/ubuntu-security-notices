  "details": "USN-7096-1 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenJDK 8. The update introduced\nseveral minor regressions. This update fixes the problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Andy Boothe discovered that the Networking component of OpenJDK 8 did not\n properly handle access under certain circumstances. An unauthenticated \n attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. \n (CVE-2024-21208)\n \n It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 did not properly\n handle vectorization under certain circumstances. An unauthenticated \n attacker could possibly use this issue to access unauthorized resources \n and expose sensitive information. (CVE-2024-21210, CVE-2024-21235)\n \n It was discovered that the Serialization component of OpenJDK 8 did not \n properly handle deserialization under certain circumstances. An \n unauthenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial\n of service. (CVE-2024-21217)\n \n It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 was not properly\n bounding certain UTF-8 strings, which could lead to a buffer overflow. An\n attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or\n execute arbitrary code. This issue was only addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.\n (CVE-2024-21131)\n \n It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 could be made to\n run into an infinite loop. If an automated system were tricked into\n processing excessively large symbols, an attacker could possibly use this\n issue to cause a denial of service. This issue was only addressed in\n Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-21138)\n \n It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 did not properly\n perform range check elimination. An attacker could possibly use this issue\n to cause a denial of service, execute arbitrary code or bypass Java\n sandbox restrictions. This issue was only addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. \n (CVE-2024-21140)\n \n Yakov Shafranovich discovered that the Concurrency component of OpenJDK 8\n incorrectly performed header validation in the Pack200 archive format. An\n attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This \n issue was only addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-21144)\n \n Sergey Bylokhov discovered that OpenJDK 8 did not properly manage memory\n when handling 2D images. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\n obtain sensitive information. This issue was only addressed in Ubuntu \n 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-21145)\n \n It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 incorrectly\n handled memory when performing range check elimination under certain\n circumstances. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a\n denial of service, execute arbitrary code or bypass Java sandbox\n restrictions. This issue was only addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. \n (CVE-2024-21147)\n \n It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 incorrectly\n handled certain exceptions with specially crafted long messages. An\n attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.\n This issue was only addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-21011)\n \n Vladimir Kondratyev discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8\n incorrectly handled address offset calculations in the C1 compiler. An\n attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service\n or execute arbitrary code. This issue was only addressed in Ubuntu\n 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-21068)\n \n Yakov Shafranovich discovered that OpenJDK 8 did not properly manage\n memory in the Pack200 archive format. An attacker could possibly use this\n issue to cause a denial of service. This issue was only addressed in\n Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-21085)\n \n It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 incorrectly\n handled array accesses in the C2 compiler. An attacker could possibly use\n this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. This\n issue was only addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-21094)\n \n Yi Yang discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 incorrectly\n handled array accesses in the C1 compiler. An attacker could possibly\n use this issue to cause a denial of service, execute arbitrary code or\n bypass Java sandbox restrictions. This issue was only addressed in Ubuntu\n 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-20918)\n \n It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 did not\n properly verify bytecode in certain situations. An attacker could\n possibly use this issue to bypass Java sandbox restrictions. This \n issue was only addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-20919)\n \n It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 had an\n optimization flaw when generating range check loop predicates. An attacker\n could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service, execute\n arbitrary code or bypass Java sandbox restrictions. This issue was only \n addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-20921)\n \n Valentin Eudeline discovered that OpenJDK 8 incorrectly handled certain\n options in the Nashorn JavaScript subcomponent. An attacker could\n possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code. This issue was only \n addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-20926)\n \n It was discovered that OpenJDK 8 could produce debug logs that contained\n private keys used for digital signatures. An attacker could possibly use\n this issue to obtain sensitive information. This issue was only addressed\n in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-20945)\n \n Hubert Kario discovered that the TLS implementation in OpenJDK 8 had a\n timing side-channel and incorrectly handled RSA padding. A remote attacker\n could possibly use this issue to recover sensitive information. This \n issue was only addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-20952)\n",
