Original advisory details:   Kevin Backhouse discovered Apport would read its user-controlled settings  file as the root user. This could be used by a local attacker to possibly  crash Apport or have other unspecified consequences. (CVE-2019-11481)   Sander Bos discovered a race-condition in Apport during core dump  creation. This could be used by a local attacker to generate a crash report  for a privileged process that is readable by an unprivileged user.  (CVE-2019-11482)   Sander Bos discovered Apport mishandled crash dumps originating from  containers. This could be used by a local attacker to generate a crash  report for a privileged process that is readable by an unprivileged user.  (CVE-2019-11483)   Sander Bos discovered Apport mishandled lock-file creation. This could be  used by a local attacker to cause a denial of service against Apport.  (CVE-2019-11485)   Kevin Backhouse discovered Apport read various process-specific files with  elevated privileges during crash dump generation. This could could be used  by a local attacker to generate a crash report for a privileged process  that is readable by an unprivileged user. (CVE-2019-15790)",
