  "details": "It was discovered that libvirt incorrectly handled certain locking\noperations. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to cause libvirt\nto stop accepting connections, resulting in a denial of service. This issue\nonly affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2021-3667)\n\nIt was discovered that libvirt incorrectly handled threads during shutdown.\nA local attacker could possibly use this issue to cause libvirt to crash,\nresulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS\nand Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2021-3975)\n\nIt was discovered that libvirt incorrectly handled the libxl driver. An\nattacker inside a guest could possibly use this issue to cause libvirtd\nto crash or stop responding, resulting in a denial of service. This issue\nonly affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 21.10.\n(CVE-2021-4147)\n\nIt was discovered that libvirt incorrectly handled the nwfilter driver. A\nlocal attacker could possibly use this issue to cause libvirt to crash,\nresulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2022-0897)\n\nIt was discovered that libvirt incorrectly handled the polkit access\ncontrol driver. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to cause\nlibvirt to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only\naffected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2020-25637)\n\nIt was discovered that libvirt incorrectly generated SELinux labels. In\nenvironments using SELinux, this issue could allow the sVirt confinement\nto be bypassed. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 20.04\nLTS. (CVE-2021-3631)\n",
