  "details": "Lei Sun discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled certain MMIO operations.\nAn attacker inside the guest could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2020-15469)\n\nWenxiang Qian discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled certain ATAPI\ncommands. An attacker inside the guest could possibly use this issue to\ncause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only\naffected Ubuntu 21.04. (CVE-2020-29443)\n\nCheolwoo Myung discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled SCSI device\nemulation. An attacker inside the guest could possibly use this issue to\ncause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2020-35504,\nCVE-2020-35505, CVE-2021-3392)\n\nAlex Xu discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the virtio-fs shared file\nsystem daemon. An attacker inside the guest could possibly use this issue\nto read and write to host devices. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.10.\n(CVE-2020-35517)\n\nIt was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled ARM Generic Interrupt\nController emulation. An attacker inside the guest could possibly use this\nissue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue\nonly affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 20.10.\n(CVE-2021-20221)\n\nAlexander Bulekov, Cheolwoo Myung, Sergej Schumilo, Cornelius Aschermann,\nand Simon Werner discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled e1000 device\nemulation. An attacker inside the guest could possibly use this issue to\ncause QEMU to hang, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only\naffected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 20.10.\n(CVE-2021-20257)\n\nIt was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled SDHCI controller emulation.\nAn attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash,\nresulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. In\nthe default installation, when QEMU is used in combination with libvirt,\nattackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor profile.\n(CVE-2021-3409)\n\nIt was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled certain NIC emulation\ndevices. An attacker inside the guest could possibly use this issue to\ncause QEMU to hang or crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue\nonly affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 20.10.\n(CVE-2021-3416)\n\nRemy Noel discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the USB redirector\ndevice. An attacker inside the guest could possibly use this issue to\ncause QEMU to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service.\n(CVE-2021-3527)\n\nIt was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the virtio vhost-user GPU\ndevice. An attacker inside the guest could possibly use this issue to cause\nQEMU to consume resources, leading to a denial of service. This issue only\naffected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.10, and Ubuntu 21.04. (CVE-2021-3544)\n\nIt was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the virtio vhost-user GPU\ndevice. An attacker inside the guest could possibly use this issue to\nobtain sensitive host information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04\nLTS, Ubuntu 20.10, and Ubuntu 21.04. (CVE-2021-3545)\n\nIt was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the virtio vhost-user GPU\ndevice. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. In the default installation, when QEMU is used in combination with\nlibvirt, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor profile. This\nissue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.10, and Ubuntu 21.04.\n(CVE-2021-3546)\n\nIt was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the PVRDMA device. An\nattacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash,\nresulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. In\nthe default installation, when QEMU is used in combination with libvirt,\nattackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor profile. This issue\nonly affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.10, and Ubuntu 21.04.\n(CVE-2021-3582, CVE-2021-3607, CVE-2021-3608)\n\nIt was discovered that QEMU SLiRP networking incorrectly handled certain\nudp packets. An attacker inside a guest could possibly use this issue to\nleak sensitive information from the host. (CVE-2021-3592, CVE-2021-3593,\nCVE-2021-3594, CVE-2021-3595)\n",
