  "summary": "dnsmasq regression",
  "details": "USN-4698-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Dnsmasq. The updates introduced\nregressions in certain environments related to issues with multiple\nqueries, and issues with retries. This update fixes the problem.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Moshe Kol and Shlomi Oberman discovered that Dnsmasq incorrectly handled\n memory when sorting RRsets. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause\n Dnsmasq to hang, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute\n arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-25681, CVE-2020-25687)\n \n Moshe Kol and Shlomi Oberman discovered that Dnsmasq incorrectly handled\n extracting certain names. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause\n Dnsmasq to hang, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute\n arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-25682, CVE-2020-25683)\n \n Moshe Kol and Shlomi Oberman discovered that Dnsmasq incorrectly\n implemented address/port checks. A remote attacker could use this issue to\n perform a cache poisoning attack. (CVE-2020-25684)\n \n Moshe Kol and Shlomi Oberman discovered that Dnsmasq incorrectly\n implemented query resource name checks. A remote attacker could use this\n issue to perform a cache poisoning attack. (CVE-2020-25685)\n \n Moshe Kol and Shlomi Oberman discovered that Dnsmasq incorrectly handled\n multiple query requests for the same resource name. A remote attacker could\n use this issue to perform a cache poisoning attack. (CVE-2020-25686)\n \n It was discovered that Dnsmasq incorrectly handled memory during DHCP\n response creation. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to\n cause Dnsmasq to consume resources, leading to a denial of service. This\n issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 20.04\n LTS. (CVE-2019-14834)\n",
