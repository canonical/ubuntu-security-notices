                "description": "USN-4191-2 fixed a vulnerability in QEMU. This update provides the corresponding update for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.  Original advisory details:   It was discovered that the LSI SCSI adapter emulator implementation in QEMU  did not properly validate executed scripts. A local attacker could use this  to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-12068)   Sergej Schumilo, Cornelius Aschermann and Simon W\u00f6rner discovered that the  qxl paravirtual graphics driver implementation in QEMU contained a null  pointer dereference. A local attacker in a guest could use this to cause a  denial of service. (CVE-2019-12155)   Riccardo Schirone discovered that the QEMU bridge helper did not properly  validate network interface names. A local attacker could possibly use this  to bypass ACL restrictions. (CVE-2019-13164)   It was discovered that a heap-based buffer overflow existed in the SLiRP  networking implementation of QEMU. A local attacker in a guest could use  this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code in the  host. (CVE-2019-14378)   It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the SLiRP  networking implementation of QEMU. A local attacker in a guest could use  this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-15890)",
