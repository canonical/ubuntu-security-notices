  "summary": "linux-bluefield vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the network traffic control implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1055)\n\nYiqi Sun and Kevin Wang discovered that the cgroups implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly restrict access to the cgroups v1\nrelease_agent feature. A local attacker could use this to gain\nadministrative privileges. (CVE-2022-0492)\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Gro\u00df discovered that the Xen subsystem within the Linux kernel did\nnot adequately limit the number of events driver domains (unprivileged PV\nbackends) could send to other guest VMs. An attacker in a driver domain\ncould use this to cause a denial of service in other guest VMs.\n(CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Gro\u00df discovered that the Xen network backend driver in the Linux\nkernel did not adequately limit the amount of queued packets when a guest\ndid not process them. An attacker in a guest VM can use this to cause a\ndenial of service (excessive kernel memory consumption) in the network\nbackend domain. (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)\n\nIt was discovered that the simulated networking device driver for the Linux\nkernel did not properly initialize memory in certain situations. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2021-4135)\n\nBrendan Dolan-Gavitt discovered that the Marvell WiFi-Ex USB device driver\nin the Linux kernel did not properly handle some error conditions. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2021-43976)\n\nIt was discovered that the ARM Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)\nsubsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition leading to a use-\nafter-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-44733)\n\nIt was discovered that the Phone Network protocol (PhoNet) implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some\nerror conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a\ndenial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-45095)\n\nWenqing Liu discovered that the f2fs file system in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly validate the last xattr entry in an inode. An attacker could\nuse this to construct a malicious f2fs image that, when mounted and\noperated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-45469)\n\nIt was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in\nsome error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a\ndenial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-45480)\n\nSamuel Page discovered that the Transparent Inter-Process Communication\n(TIPC) protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a stack-based\nbuffer overflow. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) for systems that have a TIPC bearer configured.\n(CVE-2022-0435)\n\nIt was discovered that the IPsec implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly allocate enough memory when performing ESP transformations,\nleading to a heap-based buffer overflow. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2022-27666)\n",
