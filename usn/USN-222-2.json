  "description": "USN-222-1 fixed a vulnerability in the Perl interpreter. It was\ndiscovered that the version of USN-222-1 was not sufficient to handle\nall possible cases of malformed input that could lead to arbitrary\ncode execution, so another update is necessary.\n\nOriginal advisory:\n\n  Jack Louis of Dyad Security discovered that Perl did not\n  sufficiently check the explicit length argument in format strings.\n  Specially crafted format strings with overly large length arguments\n  led to a crash of the Perl interpreter or even to execution of\n  arbitrary attacker-defined code with the privileges of the user\n  running the Perl program.\n\n  However, this attack was only possible in insecure Perl programs\n  which use variables with user-defined values in string\n  interpolations without checking their validity.",
