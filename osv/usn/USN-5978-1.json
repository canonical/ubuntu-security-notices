  "summary": "linux-oem-6.1 vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the Traffic-Control Index (TCINDEX) implementation\nin the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-1281)\n\nIt was discovered that the KVM VMX implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle indirect branch prediction isolation between L1 and L2\nVMs. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation from the host OS or other guest VMs. (CVE-2022-2196)\n\nIt was discovered that some AMD x86-64 processors with SMT enabled could\nspeculatively execute instructions using a return address from a sibling\nthread. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2022-27672)\n\nGerald Lee discovered that the USB Gadget file system implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause\na denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2022-4382)\n\nIt was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel contained a null pointer dereference in some situations. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2022-4842)\n\nKyle Zeng discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel\ncontained a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in certain situations. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-0394)\n\nIt was discovered that the Human Interface Device (HID) support driver in\nthe Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some\nsituations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2023-1073)\n\nIt was discovered that a memory leak existed in the SCTP protocol\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2023-1074)\n\nIt was discovered that the TLS subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a\ntype confusion vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2023-1075)\n\nIt was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol\nimplementation in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability\nin some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2023-1078)\n\nIt was discovered that the RNDIS USB driver in the Linux kernel contained\nan integer overflow vulnerability. A local attacker with physical access\ncould plug in a malicious USB device to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-23559)\n\nLianhui Tang discovered that the MPLS implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly handle certain sysctl allocation failure conditions,\nleading to a double-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause\na denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-26545)\n\n",
