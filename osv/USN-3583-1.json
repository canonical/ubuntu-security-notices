  "details": "It was discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the\nFlash-Friendly File System (f2fs) in the Linux kernel. An attacker could\nconstruct a malicious file system that, when mounted, could cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2017-0750)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability existed in the ALSA PCM subsystem of the Linux kernel. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-0861)\n\nIt was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel allowed\npassthrough of the diagnostic I/O port 0x80. An attacker in a guest VM\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS.\n(CVE-2017-1000407)\n\nBo Zhang discovered that the netlink wireless configuration interface in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly validate attributes when handling certain\nrequests. A local attacker with the CAP_NET_ADMIN could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-12153)\n\nVitaly Mayatskikh discovered that the SCSI subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly track reference counts when merging buffers. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2017-12190)\n\nIt was discovered that the key management subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly restrict key reads on negatively instantiated keys. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2017-12192)\n\nIt was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the sysfs interface\nfor the QLogic 24xx+ series SCSI driver in the Linux kernel. A local\nprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2017-14051)\n\nOtto Ebeling discovered that the memory manager in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly check the effective UID in some situations. A local attacker could\nuse this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-14140)\n\nIt was discovered that the ATI Radeon framebuffer driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly initialize a data structure returned to user space.\nA local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel\nmemory). (CVE-2017-14156)\n\nChunYu Wang discovered that the iSCSI transport implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate data structures. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-14489)\n\nJames Patrick-Evans discovered a race condition in the LEGO USB Infrared\nTower driver in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2017-15102)\n\nChunYu Wang discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the\nSCTP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code, (CVE-2017-15115)\n\nIt was discovered that the key management subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle NULL payloads with non-zero length values. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2017-15274)\n\nIt was discovered that the Bluebooth Network Encapsulation Protocol (BNEP)\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not validate the type of socket\npassed in the BNEPCONNADD ioctl(). A local attacker with the CAP_NET_ADMIN\nprivilege could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-15868)\n\nAndrey Konovalov discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the USB\nserial console driver in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-16525)\n\nIt was discovered that the netfilter passive OS fingerprinting (xt_osf)\nmodule did not properly perform access control checks. A local attacker\ncould improperly modify the system-wide OS fingerprint list.\n(CVE-2017-17450)\n\nIt was discovered that the HMAC implementation did not validate the state\nof the underlying cryptographic hash algorithm. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2017-17806)\n\nDenys Fedoryshchenko discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the\nnetfilter xt_TCPMSS filter of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-18017)\n\nGareth Evans discovered that the shm IPC subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly restrict mapping page zero. A local privileged attacker could\nuse this to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-5669)\n\nIt was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existing in the\nIPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (infinite loop). (CVE-2017-7542)\n\nTommi Rantala and Brad Spengler discovered that the memory manager in the\nLinux kernel did not properly enforce the CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM protection\nmechanism. A local attacker with access to /dev/mem could use this to\nexpose sensitive information or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2017-7889)\n\nMohamed Ghannam discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the DCCP\nprotocol implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2017-8824)\n\nMohamed Ghannam discovered a null pointer dereference in the RDS (Reliable\nDatagram Sockets) protocol implementation of the Linux kernel. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2018-5333)\n\n\u8303\u9f99\u98de discovered that a race condition existed in loop block device\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2018-5344)\n\nUSN-3524-1 mitigated CVE-2017-5754 (Meltdown) for the amd64\narchitecture in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. This update provides the\ncorresponding mitigations for the ppc64el architecture. Original\nadvisory details:\n\n Jann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution\n and indirect branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory reads via\n sidechannel attacks. This flaw is known as Meltdown. A local attacker could\n use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel memory.\n (CVE-2017-5754)\n\n",
