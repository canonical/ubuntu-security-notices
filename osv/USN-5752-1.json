  "details": "\nDavid Bouman and Billy Jheng Bing Jhong discovered that a race condition\nexisted in the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-\nafter-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2022-2602)\n\nS\u00f6nke Huster discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in\nthe WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel, leading to a buffer overflow. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-41674)\n\nS\u00f6nke Huster discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the\nWiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-42719)\n\nS\u00f6nke Huster discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a\nuse-after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2022-42720)\n\nS\u00f6nke Huster discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle BSSID/SSID lists in some situations. A physically\nproximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (infinite\nloop). (CVE-2022-42721)\n\nS\u00f6nke Huster discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel\ncontained a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in certain situations. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2022-42722)\n\n",
