  "details": "A bad cast was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a\nspecially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\ncause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code\nwith the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2016-1612)\n\nAn issue was discovered when initializing the UnacceleratedImageBufferSurface\nclass in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\nwebsite, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2016-1614)\n\nAn issue was discovered with the CSP implementation in Blink. If a user\nwere tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to determine whether specific HSTS sites had been\nvisited by reading a CSP report. (CVE-2016-1617)\n\nAn issue was discovered with random number generator in Blink. An attacker\ncould potentially exploit this to defeat cryptographic protection\nmechanisms. (CVE-2016-1618)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial\nof service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2016-1620)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked\nin to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\nexploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via\nrenderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nsandboxed render process. (CVE-2016-2051)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in Harfbuzz. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer\ncrash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed\nrender process.
