An attacker could possibly use this issue to expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2020-20902)\n\nIt was discovered that FFmpeg did not properly perform memory management\noperations in various of its functions. An attacker could possibly use this\nissue to send specially crafted input to the application and cause a denial of\nservice (application crash) or execute arbitrary code.

An attacker\ncould possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service (application crash)\nor execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-38114, CVE-2021-38171)\n\nIt was discovered that FFmpeg did not properly sanitize function returned data\nwhen calculating frame duration values.
