  "summary": "intel-microcode vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU\ncore may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU\ncore. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local\nattacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation (memory from other guests or the host OS). (CVE-2018-3646)\n\nJann Horn and Ken Johnson discovered that microprocessors utilizing\nspeculative execution of a memory read may allow unauthorized memory reads\nvia a sidechannel attack. This flaw is known as Spectre Variant 4. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel\nmemory. (CVE-2018-3639)\n\nZdenek Sojka, Rudolf Marek, Alex Zuepke, and Innokentiy Sennovskiy\ndiscovered that microprocessors that perform speculative reads of\nsystem registers may allow unauthorized disclosure of system parameters\nvia a sidechannel attack. This vulnerability is also known as Rogue\nSystem Register Read (RSRE). An attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2018-3640)\n",
