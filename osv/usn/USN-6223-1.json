  "details": "It was discovered that the TUN/TAP driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly initialize socket data. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1076)\n\nIt was discovered that the Real-Time Scheduling Class implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-1077)\n\nIt was discovered that the ASUS HID driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle device removal, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.\nA local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB\ndevice to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1079)\n\nIt was discovered that the Xircom PCMCIA network device driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle device removal events. A physically\nproximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2023-1670)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Xen transport layer\nimplementation for the 9P file system protocol in the Linux kernel, leading\nto a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause\na denial of service (guest crash) or expose sensitive information (guest\nkernel memory). (CVE-2023-1859)\n\nJose Oliveira and Rodrigo Branco discovered that the Spectre Variant 2\nmitigations with prctl syscall were insufficient in some situations. A\nlocal attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2023-1998)\n\nIt was discovered that the BigBen Interactive Kids' gamepad driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle device removal, leading to a use-\nafter-free vulnerability. A local attacker with physical access could plug\nin a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2023-25012)\n\nIt was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the HFS+\nfile system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could\npossibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-2985)\n\nHangyu Hua discovered that the Flower classifier implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. An attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-35788, LP: #2023577)\n\nIt was discovered that for some Intel processors the INVLPG instruction\nimplementation did not properly flush global TLB entries when PCIDs are\nenabled. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information\n(kernel memory) or possibly cause undesired behaviors. (LP: #2023220)\n",
