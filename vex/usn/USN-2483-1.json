If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted JPEG-2000 image file, a remote attacker could cause JasPer to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. (CVE-2014-8137)  Jose Duart discovered that JasPer incorrectly decoded certain malformed JPEG-2000 image files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted JPEG-2000 image file, a remote attacker could cause JasPer to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. (CVE-2014-8138)  It was discovered that JasPer incorrectly handled certain malformed JPEG-2000 image files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted JPEG-2000 image file, a remote attacker could cause JasPer to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. (CVE-2014-8157)  It was discovered that JasPer incorrectly handled memory when processing JPEG-2000 image files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted JPEG-2000 image file, a remote attacker could cause JasPer to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. (CVE-2014-8158)",
