  "summary": "linux-oem-5.14 vulnerabilities",
  "details": "Yiqi Sun and Kevin Wang discovered that the cgroups implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly restrict access to the cgroups v1\nrelease_agent feature. A local attacker could use this to gain\nadministrative privileges. (CVE-2022-0492)\n\nBrendan Dolan-Gavitt discovered that the Marvell WiFi-Ex USB device driver\nin the Linux kernel did not properly handle some error conditions. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2021-43976)\n\nWenqing Liu discovered that the f2fs file system implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate inode types while performing garbage\ncollection. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious f2fs image\nthat, when mounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2021-44879)\n\nSamuel Page discovered that the Transparent Inter-Process Communication\n(TIPC) protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a stack-based\nbuffer overflow. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) for systems that have a TIPC bearer configured.\n(CVE-2022-0435)\n\nLyu Tao discovered that the NFS implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle requests to open a directory on a regular file. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2022-24448)\n\nIt was discovered that the YAM AX.25 device driver in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly deallocate memory in some error conditions. A local privileged\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory\nexhaustion). (CVE-2022-24959)\n",
