This update reverts the update for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   Jann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution  and branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel  attacks. This flaw is known as Spectre. A local attacker could use this to  expose sensitive information, including kernel memory.   This update provides the microcode updates for AMD 17H family  processors required for the corresponding Linux kernel updates.",
