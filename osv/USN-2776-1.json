  "details": "It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not check if a new IPv6 MTU set\nby a user space application was valid. A remote attacker could forge a\nroute advertisement with an invalid MTU that a user space daemon like\nNetworkManager would honor and apply to the kernel, causing a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2015-0272)\n\nIt was discovered that virtio networking in the Linux kernel did not handle\nfragments correctly, leading to kernel memory corruption. A remote attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute code with administrative privileges. (CVE-2015-5156)\n\nIt was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not verify sockets were properly bound before\nattempting to send a message, which could cause a NULL pointer dereference.\nAn attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2015-6937)\n\nBen Hutchings discovered that the Advanced Union Filesystem (aufs) for the\nLinux kernel did not correctly handle references of memory mapped files\nfrom an aufs mount. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with\nadministrative privileges. (CVE-2015-7312)\n",
