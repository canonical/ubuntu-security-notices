  "details": "USN-4171-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Apport. This caused a regression in\nautopkgtest and python2 compatibility.  This update fixes the problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Kevin Backhouse discovered Apport would read its user-controlled settings\n file as the root user. This could be used by a local attacker to possibly\n crash Apport or have other unspecified consequences. (CVE-2019-11481)\n \n Sander Bos discovered a race-condition in Apport during core dump\n creation. This could be used by a local attacker to generate a crash report\n for a privileged process that is readable by an unprivileged user.\n (CVE-2019-11482)\n \n Sander Bos discovered Apport mishandled crash dumps originating from\n containers. This could be used by a local attacker to generate a crash\n report for a privileged process that is readable by an unprivileged user.\n (CVE-2019-11483)\n \n Sander Bos discovered Apport mishandled lock-file creation. This could be\n used by a local attacker to cause a denial of service against Apport.\n (CVE-2019-11485)\n \n Kevin Backhouse discovered Apport read various process-specific files with\n elevated privileges during crash dump generation. This could could be used\n by a local attacker to generate a crash report for a privileged process\n that is readable by an unprivileged user. (CVE-2019-15790)\n",
