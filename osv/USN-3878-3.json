  "details": "USN-3878-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel. Unfortunately,\nthat update introduced a regression that could prevent systems with\ncertain graphics chipsets from booting. This update fixes the problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that a race condition existed in the vsock address family\n implementation of the Linux kernel that could lead to a use-after-free\n condition. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to\n expose sensitive information (host machine kernel memory). (CVE-2018-14625)\n\n Cfir Cohen discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the\n KVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in\n environments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM\n virtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local\n attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative\n privileges in a host machine. (CVE-2018-16882)\n\n Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not\n properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use\n this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-19407)\n\n It was discovered that the crypto subsystem of the Linux kernel leaked\n uninitialized memory to user space in some situations. A local attacker\n could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n (CVE-2018-19854)\n",
