  "details": "Yihan Lian discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain large request\ndata values. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP\nto crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected\nUbuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2016-2519)\n\nMiroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain spoofed\naddresses when performing rate limiting. A remote attacker could possibly\nuse this issue to perform a denial of service. This issue only affected\nUbuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 16.10. (CVE-2016-7426)\n\nMatthew Van Gundy discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain crafted\nbroadcast mode packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to\nperform a denial of service.

This issue only applied\nto Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.10. (CVE-2016-7433)\n\nMagnus Stubman discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain mrulist\nqueries. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu\n16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.10. (CVE-2016-7434)\n\nMatthew Van Gund discovered that NTP incorrectly handled origin timestamp\nchecks. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a denial\nof service. This issue only affected Ubuntu Ubuntu 16.10, and Ubuntu 17.04.\n(CVE-2016-9042)\n\nMatthew Van Gundy discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain control\nmode packets. A remote attacker could use this issue to set or unset traps.\nThis issue only applied to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu\n16.10. (CVE-2016-9310)\n\nMatthew Van Gundy discovered that NTP incorrectly handled the trap service.\nA remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash,\nresulting in a denial of service. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 14.04\nLTS, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.10. (CVE-2016-9311)\n\nIt was discovered that NTP incorrectly handled memory when processing long\nvariables. A remote authenticated user could possibly use this issue to\ncause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2017-6458)\n\nIt was discovered that NTP incorrectly handled memory when processing long\nvariables. A remote authenticated user could possibly use this issue to\ncause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only\napplied to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 16.10 and Ubuntu 17.04. (CVE-2017-6460)\n\nIt was discovered that the NTP legacy DPTS refclock driver incorrectly\nhandled the /dev/datum device. A local attacker could possibly use this\nissue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2017-6462)\n\nIt was discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain invalid settings\nin a :config directive. A remote authenticated user could possibly use\nthis issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n(CVE-2017-6463)\n\nIt was discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain invalid mode\nconfiguration directives. A remote authenticated user could possibly use\nthis issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n(CVE-2017-6464)\n",
