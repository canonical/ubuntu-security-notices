This update provides the\ncorresponding updates for Ubuntu 23.10.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Jay Satiro discovered that curl incorrectly handled hostnames when using a\n SOCKS5 proxy. In environments where curl is configured to use a SOCKS5\n proxy, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary\n code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 23.04.\n (CVE-2023-38545)\n \n It was discovered that curl incorrectly handled cookies when an application\n duplicated certain handles. A local attacker could possibly create a cookie\n file and inject arbitrary cookies into subsequent connections.\n (CVE-2023-38546)\n",
