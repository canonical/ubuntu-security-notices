  "details": "USN-3741-1 introduced mitigations in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 14.04\nLTS to address L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-3620,\nCVE-2018-3646). Unfortunately, the update introduced regressions\nthat caused kernel panics when booting in some environments as well\nas preventing Java applications from starting. This update fixes\nthe problems.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU\n core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU\n core. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local\n attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to expose sensitive\n information (memory from other guests or the host OS). (CVE-2018-3646)\n\n It was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU\n core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU\n core. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local\n attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (memory from the\n kernel or other processes). (CVE-2018-3620)\n\n Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel\n performed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when\n handling incoming packets. A remote attacker could use this to cause a\n denial of service. (CVE-2018-5390)\n\n Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that the IP implementation in the Linux kernel\n performed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when\n handling incoming packet fragments. A remote attacker could use this to\n cause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-5391)\n",
