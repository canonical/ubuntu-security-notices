  "details": "USN-2553-1 fixed vulnerabilities in LibTIFF. One of the security fixes\ncaused a regression when saving certain TIFF files with a Predictor tag.\nThe problematic patch has been temporarily backed out until a more complete\nfix is available.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n William Robinet discovered that LibTIFF incorrectly handled certain\n malformed images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a\n specially crafted image, a remote attacker could crash the application,\n leading to a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code with\n user privileges. (CVE-2014-8127, CVE-2014-8128, CVE-2014-8129,\n CVE-2014-8130)\n \n Paris Zoumpouloglou discovered that LibTIFF incorrectly handled certain\n malformed BMP images. If a user or automated system were tricked into\n opening a specially crafted BMP image, a remote attacker could crash the\n application, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2014-9330)\n \n Michal Zalewski discovered that LibTIFF incorrectly handled certain\n malformed images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a\n specially crafted image, a remote attacker could crash the application,\n leading to a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code with\n user privileges.
