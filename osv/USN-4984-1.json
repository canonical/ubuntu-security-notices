  "details": "Jan Beulich discovered that the Xen netback backend in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle certain error conditions under paravirtualization. An\nattacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service\n(host domain crash). (CVE-2021-28038)\n\nIt was discovered that the Realtek RTL8188EU Wireless device driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate ssid lengths in some situations. An\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2021-28660)\n\nIt was discovered that the Xen paravirtualization backend in the Linux\nkernel did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2021-28688)\n\nIt was discovered that the fuse user space file system implementation in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly handle bad inodes in some situations. A\nlocal attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2021-28950)\n\nJohn Stultz discovered that the audio driver for Qualcomm SDM845 systems in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly validate port ID numbers. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-28952)\n\nZygo Blaxell discovered that the btrfs file system implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a race condition during certain cloning operations.\nA local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2021-28964)\n\nVince Weaver discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle certain PEBS records properly for some Intel Haswell\nprocessors. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2021-28971)\n\nIt was discovered that the RPA PCI Hotplug driver implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle device name writes via sysfs, leading\nto a buffer overflow. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2021-28972)\n\nIt was discovered that the Qualcomm IPC router implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly initialize memory passed to user space. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2021-29647)\n\nArnd Bergmann discovered that the video4linux subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2021-30002)\n\nDan Carpenter discovered that the block device manager (dm) implementation\nin the Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow in the ioctl for listing\ndevices. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2021-31916)\n\nIt was discovered that the CIPSO implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to use-\nafter-free vulnerabilities. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-33033)\n\n\u9a6c\u54f2\u5b87 discovered that the IEEE 1394 (Firewire) nosy packet sniffer driver in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some\nsituations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3483)\n",
