                "description": "Multiple use-after-free bugs were discovered in the application cache implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-6765, CVE-2015-6766, CVE-2015-6767)  Several security issues were discovered in the DOM implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to bypass same origin restrictions. (CVE-2015-6768, CVE-2015-6770)  A security issue was discovered in the provisional-load commit implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions. (CVE-2015-6769)  An out-of-bounds read was discovered in the array map and filter operations in V8 in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. (CVE-2015-6771)  It was discovered that the DOM implementation in Chromium does not prevent javascript: URL navigation while a document is being detached. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions. (CVE-2015-6772)  An out-of bounds read was discovered in Skia in some cirumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. (CVE-2015-6773)  A use-after-free was discovered in the DOM implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-6777)  It was discovered that the Document::open function in Chromium did not ensure that page-dismissal event handling is compatible with modal dialog blocking. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof application UI content. (CVE-2015-6782)  It was discovered that the page serializer in Chromium mishandled MOTW comments for URLs in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially exploit this to inject HTML content. (CVE-2015-6784)  It was discovered that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in Chromium accepted an x.y hostname as a match for a *.x.y pattern. An attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass intended access restrictions. (CVE-2015-6785)  It was discovered that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in Chromium accepted blob:, data: and filesystem: URLs as a match for a * pattern. An attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass intended access restrictions. (CVE-2015-6786)  Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-6787)  Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process.
