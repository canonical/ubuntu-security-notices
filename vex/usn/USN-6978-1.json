                "description": "It was discovered that XStream incorrectly handled parsing of certain crafted XML documents. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to read arbitrary files. (CVE-2016-3674)  Zhihong Tian and Hui Lu found that XStream was vulnerable to remote code execution. A remote attacker could run arbitrary shell commands by manipulating the processed input stream. (CVE-2020-26217)  It was discovered that XStream was vulnerable to server-side forgery attacks. A remote attacker could request data from internal resources that are not publicly available only by manipulating the processed input stream. (CVE-2020-26258)  It was discovered that XStream was vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion on the local host. A remote attacker could use this to delete arbitrary known files on the host as long as the executing process had sufficient rights only by manipulating the processed input stream. (CVE-2020-26259)  It was discovered that XStream was vulnerable to denial of service, arbitrary code execution, arbitrary file deletion and server-side forgery attacks. A remote attacker could cause any of those issues by manipulating the processed input stream.
