  "description": "Ulf Harnhammar disovered several format string vulnerabilities in\nEvolution. By tricking an user into viewing a specially crafted vCard\nattached to an email, specially crafted contact data from an LDAP\nserver, specially crafted task lists from remote servers, or saving\nCalendar entries with this malicious task list data, it was possible\nfor an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nuser running Evolution.\n\nIn addition, this update fixes a Denial of Service vulnerability in\nthe mail attachment parser. This could be exploited to crash Evolution\nby tricking an user into opening a malicious email with a specially\ncrafted attachment file name. This does only affect the Ubuntu 4.10\nversion, the Evolution package shipped with Ubuntu 5.04 is not\naffected. (CAN-2005-0806)",
