  "details": "Bodong Zhao discovered a use-after-free in the Sun keyboard driver\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2020-25669)\n\nIt was discovered that the jfs file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel contained an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker\ncould use this to possibly cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2020-27815)\n\nShisong Qin and Bodong Zhao discovered that Speakup screen reader driver in\nthe Linux kernel did not correctly handle setting line discipline in some\nsituations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2020-27830, CVE-2020-28941)\n\nIt was discovered that an information leak existed in the syscall\nimplementation in the Linux kernel on 32 bit systems. A local attacker\ncould use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2020-28588)\n\nMichael Kurth and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz discovered that the Xen event\nprocessing backend in the Linux kernel did not properly limit the number of\nevents queued. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial\nof service in the host OS. (CVE-2020-29568)\n\nOlivier Benjamin and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz discovered a race condition the\nXen paravirt block backend in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial\nof service in the host OS. (CVE-2020-29569)\n\nJann Horn discovered that the tty subsystem of the Linux kernel did not use\nconsistent locking in some situations, leading to a read-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2020-29660)\n\nJann Horn discovered a race condition in the tty subsystem of the Linux\nkernel in the locking for the TIOCSPGRP ioctl(), leading to a use-after-\nfree vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-29661)\n\nIt was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle filter rules in some situations. A local attacker with the\nCAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2021-20177)\n",
