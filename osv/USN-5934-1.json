  "details": "It was discovered that the Upper Level Protocol (ULP) subsystem in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle sockets entering the LISTEN state in\ncertain protocols, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-0461)\n\nIt was discovered that the NVMe driver in the Linux kernel did not properly\nhandle reset events in some situations. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3169)\n\nIt was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the SGI\nGRU driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2022-3424)\n\nGwangun Jung discovered a race condition in the IPv4 implementation in the\nLinux kernel when deleting multipath routes, resulting in an out-of-bounds\nread. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2022-3435)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Kernel Connection\nMultiplexor (KCM) socket implementation in the Linux kernel when releasing\nsockets in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3521)\n\nIt was discovered that the Netronome Ethernet driver in the Linux kernel\ncontained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2022-3545)\n\nIt was discovered that the hugetlb implementation in the Linux kernel\ncontained a race condition in some situations. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive\ninformation (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-3623)\n\nZiming Zhang discovered that the VMware Virtual GPU DRM driver in the Linux\nkernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2022-36280)\n\nHyunwoo Kim discovered that the DVB Core driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-\nafter-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2022-41218)\n\nIt was discovered that the Intel i915 graphics driver in the Linux kernel\ndid not perform a GPU TLB flush in some situations. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2022-4139)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Xen network backend\ndriver in the Linux kernel when handling dropped packets in certain\ncircumstances. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(kernel deadlock). (CVE-2022-42328, CVE-2022-42329)\n\nIt was discovered that the Atmel WILC1000 driver in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly validate offsets, leading to an out-of-bounds read\nvulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2022-47520)\n\nIt was discovered that the network queuing discipline implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a null pointer dereference in some situations. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2022-47929)\n\nJos\u00e9 Oliveira and Rodrigo Branco discovered that the prctl syscall\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not properly protect against\nindirect branch prediction attacks in some situations. A local attacker\ncould possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-0045)\n\nIt was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the\nAdvanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-0266)\n\nKyle Zeng discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel\ncontained a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in certain situations. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-0394)\n\nIt was discovered that the Android Binder IPC subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate inputs in some situations, leading to a use-\nafter-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-20938)\n\nKyle Zeng discovered that the class-based queuing discipline implementation\nin the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some\nsituations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2023-23454)\n\nKyle Zeng discovered that the ATM VC queuing discipline implementation in\nthe Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some\nsituations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2023-23455)\n\n",
