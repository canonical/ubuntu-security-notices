  "summary": "linux-oem-6.1 vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ATM (Asynchronous\nTransfer Mode) subsystem of the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-51780)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the AppleTalk networking\nsubsystem of the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-51781)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Rose X.25 protocol\nimplementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after- free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-51782)\n\nAlon Zahavi discovered that the NVMe-oF/TCP subsystem of the Linux kernel\ndid not properly handle connect command payloads in certain situations,\nleading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could use\nthis to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-6121)\n\nJann Horn discovered that a race condition existed in the Linux kernel when\nhandling io_uring over sockets, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.\nA local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-6531)\n\nXingyuan Mo discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle dynset expressions passed from userspace, leading to a\nnull pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-6622)\n\nIt was discovered that the IGMP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel\ncontained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-6932)\n\nRobert Morris discovered that the CIFS network file system implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not properly validate certain server commands\nfields, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. An attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2024-0565)\n\nDan Carpenter discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not store data in properly sized memory locations. A local user could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2024-0607)\n\nJann Horn discovered that the TLS subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle spliced messages, leading to an out-of-bounds write\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-0646)\n\nYang Chaoming discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate request buffer sizes, leading to an out-of-bounds\nread vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2024-22705)\n",
