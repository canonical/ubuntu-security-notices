  "details": "It was discovered that the Nouveau GPU driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle error conditions in some situations. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-25639)\n\nJan Beulich discovered that the Xen netback backend in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle certain error conditions under paravirtualization. An\nattacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service\n(host domain crash). (CVE-2021-28038)\n\nIt was discovered that the fastrpc driver in the Linux kernel did not\nprevent user space applications from sending kernel RPC messages. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges.\n(CVE-2021-28375)\n\nIt was discovered that the fuse user space file system implementation in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly handle bad inodes in some situations. A\nlocal attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2021-28950)\n",
