If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2014-3168)  A use-after-free was discovered in the DOM implementation in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2014-3169)  A use-after-free was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2014-3171)  It was discovered that WebGL clear calls did not interact properly with the state of a draw buffer. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3173)  A threading issue was discovered in the Web Audio API during attempts to update biquad filter coefficients. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3174)  Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.
