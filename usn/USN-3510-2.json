This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux\nHardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for Ubuntu\n12.04 ESM.\n\nMohamed Ghannam discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in\nthe Netlink subsystem (XFRM) in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2017-16939)\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly handle copy-on-\nwrite of transparent huge pages. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (application crashes) or possibly gain administrative\nprivileges. (CVE-2017-1000405)\n",
