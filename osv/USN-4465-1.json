  "details": "It was discovered that the XFS file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate meta data in some circumstances. An\nattacker could use this to construct a malicious XFS image that, when\nmounted, could cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-12655)\n\nIt was discovered that the bcache subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly release a lock in some error conditions. A local attacker could\npossibly use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-12771)\n\nKyungtae Kim discovered that the USB testing driver in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly deallocate memory on disconnect events. A physically proximate\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2020-15393)\n",
