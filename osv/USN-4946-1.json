Sch\u00f6nherr\ndiscovered that the Xen paravirtualization backend in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly propagate errors to frontend drivers in some situations. An\nattacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service\n(host domain crash). (CVE-2021-26930)\n\nJan Beulich discovered that multiple Xen backends in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle certain error conditions under paravirtualization. An\nattacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service\n(host domain crash). (CVE-2021-26931)\n\nJan Beulich discovered that the Xen netback backend in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle certain error conditions under paravirtualization. An\nattacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service\n(host domain crash). (CVE-2021-28038)\n\nIt was discovered that the Xen paravirtualization backend in the Linux\nkernel did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2021-28688)\n\nIt was discovered that the Freescale Gianfar Ethernet driver for the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle receive queue overrun when jumbo frames were\nenabled in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2021-29264)\n\nIt was discovered that the USB/IP driver in the Linux kernel contained race\nconditions during the update of local and shared status. An attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-29265)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the netfilter subsystem\nof the Linux kernel when replacing tables. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-29650)\n\nArnd Bergmann discovered that the video4linux subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly deallocate memory in some situations.
