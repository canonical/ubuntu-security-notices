  "details": "Loris Reiff discovered that the BPF implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly validate attributes in the getsockopt BPF hook. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2021-20194)\n\nIt was discovered that the priority inheritance futex implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3347)\n\nIt was discovered that the network block device (nbd) driver in the Linux\nkernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability during device setup. A\nlocal attacker with access to the nbd device could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2021-3348)\n",
