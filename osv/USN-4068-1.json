  "details": "Adam Zabrocki discovered that the Intel i915 kernel mode graphics driver in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly restrict mmap() ranges in some\nsituations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-11085)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition leading to a use-after-free existed\nin the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol implementation in the Linux\nkernel. The RDS protocol is disabled via blocklist by default in Ubuntu. \nIf enabled, a local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-11815)\n\nIt was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly zero out memory in some situations. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2019-11833)\n\nIt was discovered that the Bluetooth Human Interface Device Protocol (HIDP)\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not properly verify strings were\nNULL terminated in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to\nexpose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-11884)\n",
