Original advisory details:   It was discovered that Sudo did not properly parse the contents of  /proc/[pid]/stat when attempting to determine its controlling tty. A local  attacker in some configurations could possibly use this to overwrite any  file on the filesystem, bypassing intended permissions. (CVE-2017-1000368)",
