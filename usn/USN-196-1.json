  "description": "Ulf Harnhammar discovered a format string vulnerability in the CDDB\nmodule's cache file handling in the Xine library, which is\nused by packages such as xine-ui, totem-xine, and gxine.\n\nBy tricking an user into playing a particular audio CD which has a\nspecially-crafted CDDB entry, a remote attacker could exploit this\nvulnerability to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nuser running the application. Since CDDB servers usually allow anybody\nto add and modify information, this exploit does not even require a\nparticular CDDB server to be selected.",
