  "details": "It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate MFT flags in certain situations. An\nattacker could use this to construct a malicious NTFS image that, when\nmounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2022-48425)\n\nZi Fan Tan discovered that the binder IPC implementation in the Linux\nkernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2023-21255)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the f2fs file system in\nthe Linux kernel, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. An\nattacker could use this to construct a malicious f2fs image that, when\nmounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-2898)\n\nIt was discovered that the DVB Core driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle locking events in certain situations. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock).\n(CVE-2023-31084)\n\nYang Lan discovered that the GFS2 file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel could attempt to dereference a null pointer in some situations. An\nattacker could use this to construct a malicious GFS2 image that, when\nmounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-3212)\n\nIt was discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly validate buffer sizes in certain operations, leading to an out-of-\nbounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2023-38426, CVE-2023-38428)\n\nIt was discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly calculate the size of certain buffers. A remote attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2023-38429)\n",
