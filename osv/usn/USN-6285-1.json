  "details": "It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly check buffer indexes in certain situations, leading\nto an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use\nthis to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-48502)\n\nStonejiajia, Shir Tamari and Sagi Tzadik discovered that the OverlayFS\nimplementation in the Ubuntu Linux kernel did not properly perform\npermission checks in certain situations. A local attacker could possibly\nuse this to gain elevated privileges. (CVE-2023-2640)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the f2fs file system in\nthe Linux kernel, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. An\nattacker could use this to construct a malicious f2fs image that, when\nmounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-2898)\n\nMingi Cho discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly validate the status of a nft chain while performing a lookup\nby id, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2023-31248)\n\nShir Tamari and Sagi Tzadik discovered that the OverlayFS implementation in\nthe Ubuntu Linux kernel did not properly perform permission checks in\ncertain situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain\nelevated privileges. (CVE-2023-32629)\n\nIt was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle some error conditions, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3390)\n\nTanguy Dubroca discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly handle certain pointer data type, leading to an out-of-\nbounds write vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-35001)\n\nIt was discovered that the universal 32bit network packet classifier\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference\ncounting in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3609)\n\nIt was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle certain error conditions, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3610)\n\nIt was discovered that the Quick Fair Queueing network scheduler\nimplementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3611)\n\nIt was discovered that the network packet classifier with\nnetfilter/firewall marks implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle reference counting, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3776)\n\nChih-Yen Chang discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate SMB request protocol IDs, leading to a out-of-\nbounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-38430)\n\nChih-Yen Chang discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate command payload size, leading to a out-of-bounds\nread vulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-38432)\n\nIt was discovered that the NFC implementation in the Linux kernel contained\na use-after-free vulnerability when performing peer-to-peer communication\nin certain conditions. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information\n(kernel memory). (CVE-2023-3863)\n\n",
