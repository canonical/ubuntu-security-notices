A remote attacker could possibly\nuse this issue to enumerate usernames. (CVE-2016-0762)\n\nAlvaro Munoz and Alexander Mirosh discovered that Tomcat incorrectly\nlimited use of a certain utility method. A malicious application could\npossibly use this to bypass Security Manager restrictions. (CVE-2016-5018)\n\nIt was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly controlled reading system\nproperties. A malicious application could possibly use this to bypass\nSecurity Manager restrictions. (CVE-2016-6794)\n\nIt was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly controlled certain configuration\nparameters. A malicious application could possibly use this to bypass\nSecurity Manager restrictions. (CVE-2016-6796)\n\nIt was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly limited access to global JNDI\nresources. A malicious application could use this to access any global JNDI\nresource without an explicit ResourceLink.
