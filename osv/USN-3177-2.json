  "details": "USN-3177-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Tomcat. The update introduced a\nregression in environments where Tomcat is started with a security manager.\nThis update fixes the problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that the Tomcat realm implementations incorrectly handled\n passwords when a username didn't exist. A remote attacker could possibly\n use this issue to enumerate usernames. This issue only applied to Ubuntu\n 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2016-0762)\n \n Alvaro Munoz and Alexander Mirosh discovered that Tomcat incorrectly\n limited use of a certain utility method. A malicious application could\n possibly use this to bypass Security Manager restrictions. This issue only\n applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.\n (CVE-2016-5018)\n \n It was discovered that Tomcat did not protect applications from untrusted\n data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable. A remote attacker could\n possibly use this issue to redirect outbound traffic to an arbitrary proxy\n server. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and\n Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2016-5388)\n \n It was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly controlled reading system\n properties. A malicious application could possibly use this to bypass\n Security Manager restrictions. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS,\n Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2016-6794)\n \n It was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly controlled certain configuration\n parameters. A malicious application could possibly use this to bypass\n Security Manager restrictions. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS,\n Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2016-6796)\n \n It was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly limited access to global JNDI\n resources. A malicious application could use this to access any global JNDI\n resource without an explicit ResourceLink. This issue only applied to\n Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2016-6797)\n \n Regis Leroy discovered that Tomcat incorrectly filtered certain invalid\n characters from the HTTP request line. A remote attacker could possibly\n use this issue to inject data into HTTP responses. (CVE-2016-6816)\n \n Pierre Ernst discovered that the Tomcat JmxRemoteLifecycleListener did not\n implement a recommended fix. A remote attacker could possibly use this\n issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-8735)\n \n It was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly handled error handling in the\n send file code. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to access\n information from other requests. (CVE-2016-8745)\n \n Paul Szabo discovered that the Tomcat package incorrectly handled upgrades\n and removals. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain\n root privileges.
