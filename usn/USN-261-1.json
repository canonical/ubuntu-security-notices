  "description": "Stefan Esser discovered that the 'session' module did not sufficiently\nverify the validity of the user-supplied session ID. A remote attacker\ncould exploit this to insert arbitrary HTTP headers into the response\nsent by the PHP application, which could lead to HTTP Response\nSplitting (forging of arbitrary responses on behalf the PHP\napplication) and Cross Site Scripting (XSS) (execution of arbitrary\nweb script code in the client's browser) attacks. (CVE-2006-0207)\n\nPHP applications were also vulnerable to several Cross Site Scripting\n(XSS) flaws if the options 'display_errors' and 'html_errors' were\nenabled. Please note that enabling 'html_errors' is not recommended\nfor production systems. (CVE-2006-0208)",
