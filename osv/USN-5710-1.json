  "details": "It was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain X.509 Email\nAddresses. If a certificate authority were tricked into signing a\nspecially-crafted certificate, a remote attacker could possibly use this\nissue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. The\ndefault compiler options for affected releases reduce the vulnerability to\na denial of service. (CVE-2022-3602, CVE-2022-3786)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled applications creating\ncustom ciphers via the legacy EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() function. This issue\ncould cause certain applications that mishandled values to the function to\npossibly end up with a NULL cipher and messages in plaintext.\n(CVE-2022-3358)\n",
