  "details": "USN-3414-1 fixed vulnerabilities in QEMU. The patch backport for\nCVE-2017-9375 was incomplete and caused a regression in the USB xHCI\ncontroller emulation support. This update fixes the problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Leo Gaspard discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled VirtFS access control.\n A guest attacker could use this issue to elevate privileges inside the\n guest. (CVE-2017-7493)\n \n Li Qiang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled VMWare PVSCSI emulation.\n A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU\n to consume resources or crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n (CVE-2017-8112)\n \n It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled MegaRAID SAS 8708EM2 Host\n Bus Adapter emulation support. A privileged attacker inside the guest could\n use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or\n possibly to obtain sensitive host memory. This issue only affected Ubuntu\n 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 17.04. (CVE-2017-8380)\n \n Li Qiang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the Virtio GPU device. An\n attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to consume\n resources and crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only\n affected Ubuntu 17.04. (CVE-2017-9060)\n \n Li Qiang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the e1000e device. A\n privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to\n hang, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu\n 17.04. (CVE-2017-9310)\n \n Li Qiang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled USB OHCI emulation\n support. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to\n crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2017-9330)\n \n Li Qiang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled IDE AHCI emulation\n support. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to\n cause QEMU to consume resources and crash, resulting in a denial of\n service. (CVE-2017-9373)\n \n Li Qiang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled USB EHCI emulation\n support. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to\n cause QEMU to consume resources and crash, resulting in a denial of\n service. (CVE-2017-9374)\n \n Li Qiang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled USB xHCI emulation\n support. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to\n cause QEMU to hang, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2017-9375)\n \n Zhangyanyu discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled MegaRAID SAS 8708EM2\n Host Bus Adapter emulation support. A privileged attacker inside the guest\n could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of\n service. (CVE-2017-9503)\n \n It was discovered that the QEMU qemu-nbd server incorrectly handled\n initialization. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the server\n to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2017-9524)\n \n It was discovered that the QEMU qemu-nbd server incorrectly handled\n signals. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the server to\n crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2017-10664)\n \n Li Qiang discovered that the QEMU USB redirector incorrectly handled\n logging debug messages. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue\n to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2017-10806)\n \n Anthony Perard discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled Xen block-interface\n responses. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU\n to leak contents of host memory. (CVE-2017-10911)\n \n Reno Robert discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled certain DHCP options\n strings. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU\n to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2017-11434)\n \n Ryan Salsamendi discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled empty CDROM device\n drives. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to\n cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only\n affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 17.04.
