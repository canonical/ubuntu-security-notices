A malicious application could use this to access any global JNDI\nresource without an explicit ResourceLink. This issue only applied to\nUbuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2016-6797)\n\nRegis Leroy discovered that Tomcat incorrectly filtered certain invalid\ncharacters from the HTTP request line. A remote attacker could possibly\nuse this issue to inject data into HTTP responses. (CVE-2016-6816)\n\nPierre Ernst discovered that the Tomcat JmxRemoteLifecycleListener did not\nimplement a recommended fix. A remote attacker could possibly use this\nissue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-8735)\n\nIt was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly handled error handling in the\nsend file code. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to access\ninformation from other requests. (CVE-2016-8745)\n\nPaul Szabo discovered that the Tomcat package incorrectly handled upgrades\nand removals. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain\nroot privileges.
