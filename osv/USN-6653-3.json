  "details": "It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ATM (Asynchronous\nTransfer Mode) subsystem of the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-51780)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the AppleTalk networking\nsubsystem of the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-51781)\n\nZhenghan Wang discovered that the generic ID allocator implementation in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly check for null bitmap when releasing IDs.\nA local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2023-6915)\n\nRobert Morris discovered that the CIFS network file system implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not properly validate certain server commands\nfields, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. An attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2024-0565)\n\nJann Horn discovered that the TLS subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle spliced messages, leading to an out-of-bounds write\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-0646)\n",
