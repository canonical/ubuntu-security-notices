  "description": "It was discovered that Squid did not verify the validity of DNS server\nresponses. When Squid is started, it opens a DNS client UDP port whose\nnumber is randomly assigned by the operating system. Unless your\nnetwork firewall is configured to accept DNS responses only from known\ngood nameservers, this vulnerability allowed users within the local\nnetwork to inject arbitrary DNS responses into Squid (\"DNS spoofing\").\nThis could be used to present different web pages to users from those\nthey actually requested.",
