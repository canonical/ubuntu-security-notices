  "description": "xpdf and kpdf did not sufficiently verify the validity of the \"loca\"\ntable in PDF files, a table that contains glyph description\ninformation for embedded TrueType fonts. After detecting the broken\ntable, xpdf attempted to reconstruct the information in it, which\ncaused the generation of a huge temporary file that quickly filled up\navailable disk space and rendered the application unresponsive.\n\nThe CUPS printing system in Ubuntu 5.04 uses the xpdf-utils package to\nconvert PDF files to PostScript. By attempting to print such a crafted\nPDF file, a remote attacker could cause a Denial of Service in a print\nserver. The CUPS system in Ubuntu 4.10 is not vulnerable against this\nattack.",
