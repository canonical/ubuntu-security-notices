  "details": "It was discovered that the QLogic Fibre Channel driver in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly check for error, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. A\nlocal attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2019-16233)\n\nIt was discovered that the Intel Wi-Fi driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly check for errors in some situations. A local attacker could\npossibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2019-16234)\n\nTristan Madani discovered that the block I/O tracing implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2019-19768)\n\nIt was discovered that the virtual terminal implementation in the Linux\nkernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could possibly use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive\ninformation.
