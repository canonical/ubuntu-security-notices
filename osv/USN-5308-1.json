  "details": "It was discovered that libssh2 mishandled certain input. If libssh2 were\nused to connect to a malicious or compromised SSH server, a remote,\nunauthenticated attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code on the client \nsystem. (CVE-2019-3855)\n\nIt was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled prompt requests. A\nremote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2019-3856)\n\nIt was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST\npackets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute\narbitrary code, cause a denial of service, or obtain sensitive information. \n(CVE-2019-3857, CVE-2019-3862)\n\nIt was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled specially crafted SFTP\npackets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial\nof service or obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2019-3858)\n\nIt was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled certain specially\ncrafted packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a\ndenial of service or obtain sensitive information.

A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial\nof service or obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2019-3861)\n\nIt was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled interactive response\nmessages length. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2019-3863)\n\nIt was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled the Diffie Hellman key\nexchange. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial\nof service or obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2019-13115)\n\nIt was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled bound checks in\nSSH_MSG_DISCONNECT.
