  "details": "It was discovered that the BPF verifier in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly restrict pointer types in certain situations. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-23222)\n\nIt was discovered that the network traffic control implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1055)\n\nYiqi Sun and Kevin Wang discovered that the cgroups implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly restrict access to the cgroups v1\nrelease_agent feature. A local attacker could use this to gain\nadministrative privileges. (CVE-2022-0492)\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Gro\u00df discovered that the Xen subsystem within the Linux kernel did\nnot adequately limit the number of events driver domains (unprivileged PV\nbackends) could send to other guest VMs. An attacker in a driver domain\ncould use this to cause a denial of service in other guest VMs.\n(CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Gro\u00df discovered that the Xen network backend driver in the Linux\nkernel did not adequately limit the amount of queued packets when a guest\ndid not process them. An attacker in a guest VM can use this to cause a\ndenial of service (excessive kernel memory consumption) in the network\nbackend domain. (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)\n\nSzymon Heidrich discovered that the USB Gadget subsystem in the Linux\nkernel did not properly restrict the size of control requests for certain\ngadget types, leading to possible out of bounds reads or writes. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-39685)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the poll implementation\nin the Linux kernel, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-39698)\n\nIt was discovered that the simulated networking device driver for the Linux\nkernel did not properly initialize memory in certain situations. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2021-4135)\n\nEric Biederman discovered that the cgroup process migration implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not perform permission checks correctly in some\nsituations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain administrative\nprivileges. (CVE-2021-4197)\n\nBrendan Dolan-Gavitt discovered that the aQuantia AQtion Ethernet device\ndriver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate meta-data coming from\nthe device. A local attacker who can control an emulated device can use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2021-43975)\n\nIt was discovered that the ARM Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)\nsubsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition leading to a use-\nafter-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-44733)\n\nIt was discovered that the Phone Network protocol (PhoNet) implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some\nerror conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a\ndenial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-45095)\n\nIt was discovered that the eBPF verifier in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly perform bounds checking on mov32 operations. A local attacker\ncould use this to expose sensitive information (kernel pointer addresses).\n(CVE-2021-45402)\n\nIt was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in\nsome error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a\ndenial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-45480)\n\nIt was discovered that the BPF subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly track pointer types on atomic fetch operations in some situations.\nA local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel\npointer addresses). (CVE-2022-0264)\n\nIt was discovered that the TIPC Protocol implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly initialize memory in some situations. A local attacker\ncould use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2022-0382)\n\nSamuel Page discovered that the Transparent Inter-Process Communication\n(TIPC) protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a stack-based\nbuffer overflow. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) for systems that have a TIPC bearer configured.\n(CVE-2022-0435)\n\nIt was discovered that the KVM implementation for s390 systems in the Linux\nkernel did not properly prevent memory operations on PVM guests that were\nin non-protected mode. A local attacker could use this to obtain\nunauthorized memory write access. (CVE-2022-0516)\n\nIt was discovered that the ICMPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly deallocate memory in certain situations. A remote attacker\ncould possibly use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2022-0742)\n\nIt was discovered that the IPsec implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly allocate enough memory when performing ESP transformations,\nleading to a heap-based buffer overflow. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2022-27666)\n",
