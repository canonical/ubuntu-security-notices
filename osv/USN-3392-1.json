  "details": "USN-3378-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel. Unfortunately, a\nregression was introduced that prevented conntrack from working\ncorrectly in some situations. This update fixes the problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Fan Wu and Shixiong Zhao discovered a race condition between inotify events\n and vfs rename operations in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local\n attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\n execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-7533)\n\n It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly restrict\n RLIMIT_STACK size. A local attacker could use this in conjunction with\n another vulnerability to possibly execute arbitrary code.\n (CVE-2017-1000365)\n\n \u674e\u5f3a discovered that the Virtio GPU driver in the Linux kernel did not\n properly free memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to\n cause a denial of service (memory consumption). (CVE-2017-10810)\n\n \u77f3\u78ca discovered that the RxRPC Kerberos 5 ticket handling code in the\n Linux kernel did not properly verify metadata. A remote attacker could use\n this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\n arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-7482)\n",
