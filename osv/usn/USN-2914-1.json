  "details": "Yuval Yarom, Daniel Genkin, and Nadia Heninger discovered that OpenSSL was\nvulnerable to a side-channel attack on modular exponentiation. On certain\nCPUs, a local attacker could possibly use this issue to recover RSA keys.\nThis flaw is known as CacheBleed. (CVE-2016-0702)\n\nAdam Langley discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when\nparsing DSA private keys. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause\nOpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2016-0705)\n\nGuido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled hex digit\ncalculation in the BN_hex2bn function. A remote attacker could use this\nissue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-0797)\n\nEmilia K\u00e4sper discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when\nperforming SRP user database lookups. A remote attacker could possibly use\nthis issue to cause OpenSSL to consume memory, resulting in a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2016-0798)\n\nGuido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when\nprinting very long strings. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause\nOpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2016-0799)\n",
