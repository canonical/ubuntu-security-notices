  "summary": "linux-oem-5.17 vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the Traffic-Control Index (TCINDEX) implementation\nin the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-1281)\n\nIt was discovered that the Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA)\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not properly enforce policy in\ncertain conditions. A privileged attacker could use this to bypass Kernel\nlockdown restrictions. (CVE-2022-21505)\n\nIt was discovered that the infrared transceiver USB driver did not properly\nhandle USB control messages. A local attacker with physical access could\nplug in a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (memory\nexhaustion). (CVE-2022-3903)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the SMSC UFX USB driver\nimplementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2022-41849)\n\nGerald Lee discovered that the USB Gadget file system implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause\na denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2022-4382)\n\nIt was discovered that a memory leak existed in the SCTP protocol\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2023-1074)\n\nMingi Cho discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly initialize a data structure, leading to a null pointer\ndereference vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2023-1095)\n\nIt was discovered that the RNDIS USB driver in the Linux kernel contained\nan integer overflow vulnerability. A local attacker with physical access\ncould plug in a malicious USB device to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-23559)\n\nIt was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate attributes in certain situations, leading\nto an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use\nthis to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-26607)\n\nDuoming Zhou discovered that a race condition existed in the infrared\nreceiver/transceiver driver in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-\nfree vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-1118)\n\n",
