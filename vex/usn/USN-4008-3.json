                "description": "USN-4008-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.  Robert \u015awi\u0119cki discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly apply Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) in some situations for setuid elf binaries. A local attacker could use this to improve the chances of exploiting an existing vulnerability in a setuid elf binary. (CVE-2019-11190)  It was discovered that a null pointer dereference vulnerability existed in the LSI Logic MegaRAID driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-11810)  It was discovered that a race condition leading to a use-after-free existed in the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol implementation in the Linux kernel. The RDS protocol is disabled via blocklist by default in Ubuntu.  If enabled, a local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-11815)  Federico Manuel Bento discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly apply Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) in some situations for setuid a.out binaries. A local attacker could use this to improve the chances of exploiting an existing vulnerability in a setuid a.out binary. (CVE-2019-11191)  As a hardening measure, this update disables a.out support.",
