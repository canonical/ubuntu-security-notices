This update provides\nthe corresponding update for Ubuntu 12.04 ESM.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Marcus Brinkmann discovered that during decryption or verification,\n GnuPG did not properly filter out terminal sequences when reporting the\n original filename. An attacker could use this to specially craft a file\n that would cause an application parsing GnuPG output to incorrectly\n interpret the status of the cryptographic operation reported by GnuPG.\n (CVE-2018-12020)\n",
