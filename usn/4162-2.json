  "description": "USN-4162-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04\nLTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux\nkernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.\n\nIt was discovered that the RSI 91x Wi-Fi driver in the Linux kernel did not\ndid not handle detach operations correctly, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2018-21008)\n\nWen Huang discovered that the Marvell Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly perform bounds checking, leading to a heap\noverflow. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-14814,\nCVE-2019-14815, CVE-2019-14816)\n\nMatt Delco discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly perform bounds checking when handling coalesced\nMMIO write operations. A local attacker with write access to /dev/kvm could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-14821)\n\nHui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB audio driver for the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate device meta data. A physically\nproximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2019-15117)\n\nHui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB audio driver for the\nLinux kernel improperly performed recursion while handling device meta\ndata. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2019-15118)\n\nIt was discovered that the Technisat DVB-S/S2 USB device driver in the\nLinux kernel contained a buffer overread. A physically proximate attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexpose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-15505)\n\nBrad Spengler discovered that a Spectre mitigation was improperly\nimplemented in the ptrace susbsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker\ncould possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-15902)\n\nIt was discovered that the SMB networking file system implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a buffer overread. An attacker could use this to\nexpose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-15918)\n",
