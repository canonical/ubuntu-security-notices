  "details": "Ryota Shiga discovered that the sockopt BPF hooks in the Linux kernel could\nallow a user space program to probe for valid kernel addresses. A local\nattacker could use this to ease exploitation of another kernel\nvulnerability. (CVE-2021-20239)\n\nIt was discovered that the BPF verifier in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle signed add32 and sub integer overflows. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-20268)\n\nIt was discovered that the priority inheritance futex implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3347)\n\nIt was discovered that the network block device (nbd) driver in the Linux\nkernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability during device setup. A\nlocal attacker with access to the nbd device could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2021-3348)\n\n\u5434\u5f02 discovered that the NFS implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly prevent access outside of an NFS export that is a subdirectory of\na file system. An attacker could possibly use this to bypass NFS access\nrestrictions. (CVE-2021-3178)\n",
