  "description": "Charles Morris discovered a race condition in sudo which could lead to\nprivilege escalation. If /etc/sudoers allowed a user the execution of\nselected programs, and this was followed by another line containing\nthe pseudo-command \"ALL\", that user could execute arbitrary commands\nwith sudo by creating symbolic links at a certain time.\n\nPlease note that this does not affect a standard Ubuntu installation.",
