  "description": "USN-6369-1 fixed a vulnerability in libwebp. This update provides the\ncorresponding update for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that libwebp incorrectly handled certain malformed\n images.  If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a\n specially crafted image file, a remote attacker could use this issue to\n cause libwebp to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly\n execute arbitrary code.\n",
