                "description": "USN-4227-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.  It was discovered that a heap-based buffer overflow existed in the Marvell WiFi-Ex Driver for the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-14895, CVE-2019-14901)  It was discovered that a heap-based buffer overflow existed in the Marvell Libertas WLAN Driver for the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-14896, CVE-2019-14897)  It was discovered that the Fujitsu ES network device driver for the Linux kernel did not properly check for errors in some situations, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-16231)  It was discovered that the QLogic Fibre Channel driver in the Linux kernel did not properly check for error, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-16233)  Anthony Steinhauser discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly perform Spectre_RSB mitigations to all processors for PowerPC architecture systems in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-18660)  It was discovered that the Mellanox Technologies Innova driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain failure conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19045)  It was discovered that Geschwister Schneider USB CAN interface driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain failure conditions. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19052)  It was discovered that the AMD Display Engine Driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attack could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19083)  It was discovered that the driver for memoryless force-feedback input devices in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-19524)  It was discovered that the Microchip CAN BUS Analyzer driver in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability on device disconnect. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-19529)  It was discovered that the PEAK-System Technik USB driver in the Linux kernel did not properly sanitize memory before sending it to the device. A physically proximate attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-19534)  Tristan Madani discovered that the ALSA timer implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-19807)",
