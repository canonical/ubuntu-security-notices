  "summary": "linux-bluefield, linux-gke-5.4, linux-oracle, linux-oracle-5.4, linux-raspi, linux-raspi-5.4 vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the f2fs file system in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly validate metadata in some situations. An attacker could use this\nto construct a malicious f2fs image that, when mounted and operated on,\ncould cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2019-19449)\n\nIt was discovered that the Infiniband RDMA userspace connection manager\nimplementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition leading to a\nuse-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possible execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2020-36385)\n\nWolfgang Frisch discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained an integer overflow when handling metadata inode\nextents. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 file\nsystem image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2021-3428)\n\nBenedict Schlueter discovered that the BPF subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly protect against Speculative Store Bypass (SSB) side-\nchannel attacks in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use\nthis to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-34556)\n\nPiotr Krysiuk discovered that the BPF subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly protect against Speculative Store Bypass (SSB) side-channel\nattacks in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to\nexpose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-35477)\n\nIt was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle removing a non-existent device id. An attacker with\nCAP_SYS_ADMIN could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2021-3739)\n\nIt was discovered that the Qualcomm IPC Router protocol implementation in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly validate metadata in some situations. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-3743)\n\nIt was discovered that the virtual terminal (vt) device implementation in\nthe Linux kernel contained a race condition in its ioctl handling that led\nto an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use\nthis to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-3753)\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly account for the\nmemory usage of certain IPC objects. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-3759)\n",
