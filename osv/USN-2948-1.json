  "details": "Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the\ndevice. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2015-7566)\n\nRalf Spenneberg discovered that the usbvision driver in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate the interfaces and endpoints reported by the\ndevice. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2015-7833)\n\nVenkatesh Pottem discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux\nkernel's CXGB3 driver. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-8812)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the ioctl handler for\nthe TTY driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2016-0723)\n\nXiaofei Rex Guo discovered a timing side channel vulnerability in the Linux\nExtended Verification Module (EVM). An attacker could use this to affect\nsystem integrity. (CVE-2016-2085)\n\nDavid Herrmann discovered that the Linux kernel incorrectly accounted file\ndescriptors to the original opener for in-flight file descriptors sent over\na unix domain socket. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (resource exhaustion). (CVE-2016-2550)\n\nRalf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Treo devices in the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the\ndevice. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2016-2782)\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel did not enforce limits on the\namount of data allocated to buffer pipes. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion). (CVE-2016-2847)\n",
