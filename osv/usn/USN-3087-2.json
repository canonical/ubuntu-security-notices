  "details": "USN-3087-1 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenSSL. The fix for CVE-2016-2182 was\nincomplete and caused a regression when parsing certificates. This update\nfixes the problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled the OCSP Status Request\n extension. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause memory\n consumption, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-6304)\n \n Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL used undefined behaviour when\n performing pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use this\n issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This\n issue has only been addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS in this update.\n (CVE-2016-2177)\n \n C\u00e9sar Pereida, Billy Brumley, and Yuval Yarom discovered that OpenSSL\n did not properly use constant-time operations when performing DSA signing.\n A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a cache-timing\n attack and recover private DSA keys. (CVE-2016-2178)\n \n Quan Luo discovered that OpenSSL did not properly restrict the lifetime\n of queue entries in the DTLS implementation. A remote attacker could\n possibly use this issue to consume memory, resulting in a denial of\n service. (CVE-2016-2179)\n \n Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory in the\n TS_OBJ_print_bio() function. A remote attacker could possibly use this\n issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-2180)\n \n It was discovered that the OpenSSL incorrectly handled the DTLS anti-replay\n feature. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial\n of service. (CVE-2016-2181)\n \n Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly validated division results. A\n remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.\n (CVE-2016-2182)\n \n Karthik Bhargavan and Gaetan Leurent discovered that the DES and Triple DES\n ciphers were vulnerable to birthday attacks. A remote attacker could\n possibly use this flaw to obtain clear text data from long encrypted\n sessions. This update moves DES from the HIGH cipher list to MEDIUM.\n (CVE-2016-2183)\n \n Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain ticket lengths.\n A remote attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service.\n (CVE-2016-6302)\n \n Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory in the\n MDC2_Update() function. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to\n cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-6303)\n \n Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly performed certain message\n length checks. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a\n denial of service. (CVE-2016-6306)\n",
