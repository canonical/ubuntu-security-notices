  "description": "USN-148-1 and USN-151-1 fixed two security flaws in zlib, which could\nbe exploited to cause Denial of Service attacks or even arbitrary code\nexecution with malicious data streams.\n\nSince lsb-rpm is statically linked against the zlib library, it is also\naffected by these issues. The updated packagages have been rebuilt\nagainst the fixed zlib.\n\nPlease note that lsb-rpm is not officially supported (it is in the \"universe\"\ncomponent of the archive).",
