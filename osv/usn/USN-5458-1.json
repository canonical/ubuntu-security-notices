An\nattacker could possibly use this issue to expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2021-4193)\n\nIt was discovered that Vim was not properly performing bounds checks\nwhen updating windows present on a screen, which could result in a\nheap buffer overflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\ncause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-0213)\n\nIt was discovered that Vim was incorrectly handling window\nexchanging operations when in Visual mode, which could result in an\nout-of-bounds read. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\nexpose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-0319)\n\nIt was discovered that Vim was incorrectly handling recursion when\nparsing conditional expressions. An attacker could possibly use this\nissue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2022-0351)\n\nIt was discovered that Vim was not properly handling memory\nallocation when processing data in Ex mode, which could result in a\nheap buffer overflow.

(CVE-2022-0408)\n\nIt was discovered that Vim was incorrectly handling memory access\nwhen executing buffer operations, which could result in the usage of\nfreed memory.
