  "details": "It was discovered that the ContainerNode::parserRemoveChild function in\nBlink mishandled widget updates in some circumstances. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions.\n(CVE-2016-1630)\n\nIt was discovered that the PPB_Flash_MessageLoop_Impl::InternalRun \nfunction in Chromium mishandled nested message loops. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions.\n(CVE-2016-1631)\n\nMultiple use-after-frees were discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked\nin to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\nexploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process.\n(CVE-2016-1633, CVE-2016-1634, CVE-2016-1644)\n\nIt was discovered that the PendingScript::notifyFinished function in\nBlink relied on memory-cache information about integrity-check occurrences\ninstead of integrity-check successes. If a user were tricked in to opening\na specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\nbypass Subresource Integrity (SRI) protections. (CVE-2016-1636)\n\nIt was discovered that the SkATan2_255 function in Skia mishandled\narctangent calculations. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially\ncrafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain\nsensitive information. (CVE-2016-1637)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.\n(CVE-2016-1641)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial\nof service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2016-1642)\n\nA type-confusion bug was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in\nto opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\nexploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process.\n(CVE-2016-1643)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked\nin to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\nexploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via\nrenderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nsandboxed render process. (CVE-2016-2843)\n\nAn invalid cast was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2016-2844)\n\nIt was discovered that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in\nBlink did not ignore a URL's path component in the case of a ServiceWorker\nfetch. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,\nan attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2016-2845)\n",
