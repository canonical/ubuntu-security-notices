  "description": "Wouter Hanegraaff discovered that the TIFF library did not\nsufficiently validate the \"YCbCr subsampling\" value in TIFF image\nheaders. Decoding a malicious image with a zero value resulted in an\narithmetic exception, which caused the program that uses the TIFF\nlibrary to crash. This leads to a Denial of Service in server\napplications that use libtiff (like the CUPS printing system) and can\ncause data loss in, for example, the Evolution email client.",
