  "description": "Ulf Harnhammar discovered a remote vulnerability in Lynx when\nconnecting to a news server (NNTP). The function that added missing\nescape chararacters to article headers did not check the size of the\ntarget buffer. Specially crafted news entries could trigger a buffer\noverflow, which could be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user running lynx. In order to exploit this, the\nuser is not even required to actively visit a news site with Lynx\nsince a malicious HTML page could automatically redirect to an nntp://\nURL with malicious news items.",
