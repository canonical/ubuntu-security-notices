If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted\nPDF file, an attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute\narbitrary code with privileges of the user invoking the program.\n(CVE-2017-2820)\n\nJiaqi Peng discovered that the poppler pdfunite tool incorrectly parsed\ncertain malformed PDF documents. If a user or automated system were tricked\ninto opening a crafted PDF file, an attacker could cause poppler to crash,\nresulting in a denial of service.

If a user or automated system were tricked into\nopening a crafted PDF file, an attacker could cause poppler to hang,\nresulting in a denial of service.

(CVE-2017-9083)\n\nIt was discovered that poppler incorrectly handled memory when processing\nPDF documents. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a\ncrafted PDF file, an attacker could cause poppler to consume resources,\nresulting in a denial of service.
