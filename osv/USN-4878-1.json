  "details": "It was discovered that the Marvell WiFi-Ex device driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate ad-hoc SSIDs. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2020-36158)\n\nRyota Shiga discovered that the sockopt BPF hooks in the Linux kernel could\nallow a user space program to probe for valid kernel addresses. A local\nattacker could use this to ease exploitation of another kernel\nvulnerability. (CVE-2021-20239)\n\nIt was discovered that the priority inheritance futex implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3347)\n\n\u5434\u5f02 discovered that the NFS implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly prevent access outside of an NFS export that is a subdirectory of\na file system. An attacker could possibly use this to bypass NFS access\nrestrictions. (CVE-2021-3178)\n",
