  "details": "It was discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the\nVideo for Linux 2 (V4L2) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-20369)\n\nPawan Kumar Gupta, Alyssa Milburn, Amit Peled, Shani Rehana, Nir Shildan\nand Ariel Sabba discovered that some Intel processors with Enhanced\nIndirect Branch Restricted Speculation (eIBRS) did not properly handle RET\ninstructions after a VM exits. A local attacker could potentially use this\nto expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-26373)\n\nDavid Leadbeater discovered that the netfilter IRC protocol tracking\nimplementation in the Linux Kernel incorrectly handled certain message\npayloads in some situations. A remote attacker could possibly use this to\ncause a denial of service or bypass firewall filtering. (CVE-2022-2663)\n\nJohannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi discovered that for some AMD x86-64\nprocessors, the branch predictor could by mis-trained for return\ninstructions in certain circumstances. A local attacker could possibly use\nthis to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-29900)\n\nJohannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi discovered that for some Intel x86-64\nprocessors, the Linux kernel's protections against speculative branch\ntarget injection attacks were insufficient in some circumstances. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2022-29901)\n\nIt was discovered that the NILFS2 file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. An\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2022-3646)\n\nKhalid Masum discovered that the NILFS2 file system implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a\nuse-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3649)\n\nHyunwoo Kim discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in\nthe PXA3xx graphics driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could\npossibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2022-39842)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the SMSC UFX USB driver\nimplementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2022-41849)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Roccat HID driver in\nthe Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-41850)\n\nIt was discovered that the USB monitoring (usbmon) component in the Linux\nkernel did not properly set permissions on memory mapped in to user space\nprocesses. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-43750)\n\n",
