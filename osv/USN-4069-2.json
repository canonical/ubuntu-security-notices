  "details": "USN-4069-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 19.04.\nThis update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware\nEnablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 19.04 for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.\n\nIt was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the Linux kernel when\nreference counting pages, leading to potential use-after-free issues. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-11487)\n\nJann Horn discovered that a race condition existed in the Linux kernel when\nperforming core dumps. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-11599)\n\nIt was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly zero out memory in some situations. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2019-11833)\n\nIt was discovered that the Bluetooth Human Interface Device Protocol (HIDP)\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not properly verify strings were\nNULL terminated in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to\nexpose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-11884)\n",
