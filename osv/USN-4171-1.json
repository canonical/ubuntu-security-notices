  "details": "Kevin Backhouse discovered Apport would read its user-controlled settings\nfile as the root user. This could be used by a local attacker to possibly\ncrash Apport or have other unspecified consequences. (CVE-2019-11481)\n\nSander Bos discovered a race-condition in Apport during core dump\ncreation. This could be used by a local attacker to generate a crash report\nfor a privileged process that is readable by an unprivileged user.\n(CVE-2019-11482)\n\nSander Bos discovered Apport mishandled crash dumps originating from\ncontainers. This could be used by a local attacker to generate a crash\nreport for a privileged process that is readable by an unprivileged user.\n(CVE-2019-11483)\n\nSander Bos discovered Apport mishandled lock-file creation. This could be\nused by a local attacker to cause a denial of service against Apport.\n(CVE-2019-11485)\n\nKevin Backhouse discovered Apport read various process-specific files with\nelevated privileges during crash dump generation. This could could be used\nby a local attacker to generate a crash report for a privileged process\nthat is readable by an unprivileged user. (CVE-2019-15790)\n",
