  "details": "It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled a PRDT with zero complete\nsectors in the IDE functionality. A malicious guest could possibly use\nthis issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu\n12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2014-9718)\n\nDonghai Zhu discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the RTL8139 driver.\nA malicious guest could possibly use this issue to read sensitive\ninformation from arbitrary host memory. (CVE-2015-5165)\n\nDonghai Zhu discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled unplugging emulated\nblock devices. A malicious guest could use this issue to cause a denial of\nservice, or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host as the user running\nthe QEMU process. In the default installation, when QEMU is used with\nlibvirt, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor profile. This\nissue only affected Ubuntu 15.04. (CVE-2015-5166)\n\nQinghao Tang and Mr. Zuozhi discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled memory\nin the VNC display driver. A malicious guest could use this issue to cause\na denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host as the\nuser running the QEMU process. In the default installation, when QEMU is\nused with libvirt, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor\nprofile. This issue only affected Ubuntu 15.04.
