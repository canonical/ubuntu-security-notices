  "description": "Tavis Ormandy discovered a buffer overflow in the TIFF library.  A\nmalicious image with an invalid \"bits per sample\" number could be\nconstructed which, when decoded, would have resulted in execution of\narbitrary code with the privileges of the process using the library.\n\nSince this library is used in many applications like \"ghostscript\" and\nthe \"CUPS\" printing system, this vulnerability may lead to remotely\ninduced privilege escalation.",
