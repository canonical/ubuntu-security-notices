  "description": "USN-3422-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 14.04\nLTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux\nHardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for Ubuntu\n12.04 LTS.\n\nIt was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the Bluetooth stack of\nthe Linux kernel when handling L2CAP configuration responses. A physically\nproximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2017-1000251)\n\nIt was discovered that the asynchronous I/O (aio) subsystem of the Linux\nkernel did not properly set permissions on aio memory mappings in some\nsituations. An attacker could use this to more easily exploit other\nvulnerabilities. (CVE-2016-10044)\n\nBaozeng Ding and Andrey Konovalov discovered a race condition in the L2TPv3\nIP Encapsulation implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2016-10200)\n\nAndreas Gruenbacher and Jan Kara discovered that the filesystem\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not clear the setgid bit during a\nsetxattr call. A local attacker could use this to possibly elevate group\nprivileges. (CVE-2016-7097)\n\nSergej Schumilo, Ralf Spenneberg, and Hendrik Schwartke discovered that the\nkey management subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly allocate\nmemory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-8650)\n\nVlad Tsyrklevich discovered an integer overflow vulnerability in the VFIO\nPCI driver for the Linux kernel. A local attacker with access to a vfio PCI\ndevice file could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-9083, CVE-2016-9084)\n\nIt was discovered that an information leak existed in __get_user_asm_ex()\nin the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2016-9178)\n\nCAI Qian discovered that the sysctl implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly perform reference counting in some situations. An unprivileged\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system hang).\n(CVE-2016-9191)\n\nIt was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel in\nsome situations did not prevent special internal keyrings from being joined\nby userspace keyrings. A privileged local attacker could use this to bypass\nmodule verification. (CVE-2016-9604)\n\nIt was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the trace subsystem\nof the Linux kernel. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-9754)\n\nAndrey Konovalov discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle invalid IP options in some situations. An\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2017-5970)\n\nDmitry Vyukov discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly handle TCP\npackets with the URG flag. A remote attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2017-6214)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the AF_PACKET handling\ncode in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2017-6346)\n\nIt was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly restrict searches for dead keys. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-6951)\n\nDmitry Vyukov discovered that the generic SCSI (sg) subsystem in the Linux\nkernel contained a stack-based buffer overflow. A local attacker with\naccess to an sg device could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-7187)\n\nEric Biggers discovered a memory leak in the keyring implementation in the\nLinux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(memory consumption). (CVE-2017-7472)\n\nIt was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the Broadcom FullMAC\nWLAN driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2017-7541)\n",
