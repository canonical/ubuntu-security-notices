  "summary": "linux-lts-utopic vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the\nAF_UNIX implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use\ncrafted epoll_ctl calls to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\nexpose sensitive information. (CVE-2013-7446)\n\nIt was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly restore the values of the Programmable Interrupt Timer (PIT). A\nuser-assisted attacker in a KVM guest could cause a denial of service in\nthe host (system crash). (CVE-2015-7513)\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel keyring subsystem contained a race\nbetween read and revoke operations. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-7550)\n\nSasha Levin discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS)\nimplementation in the Linux kernel had a race condition when checking\nwhether a socket was bound or not. A local attacker could use this to cause\na denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-7990)\n\nIt was discovered that the Btrfs implementation in the Linux kernel\nincorrectly handled compressed inline extants on truncation. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2015-8374)\n\n\u90ed\u6c38\u521a discovered that the Linux kernel networking implementation did\nnot validate protocol identifiers for certain protocol families, A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2015-8543)\n\nDmitry Vyukov discovered that the pptp implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not verify an address length when setting up a socket. A local attacker\ncould use this to craft an application that exposed sensitive information\nfrom kernel memory. (CVE-2015-8569)\n\nDavid Miller discovered that the Bluetooth implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate the socket address length for Synchronous\nConnection-Oriented (SCO) sockets. A local attacker could use this to\nexpose sensitive information. (CVE-2015-8575)\n",
