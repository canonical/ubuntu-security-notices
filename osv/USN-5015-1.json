  "summary": "linux-oem-5.10 vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the virtual file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel contained an unsigned to signed integer conversion error. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-33909)\n\nMichael Brown discovered that the Xen netback driver in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly handle malformed packets from a network PV frontend,\nleading to a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker in a guest VM could\nuse this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2021-28691)\n\nIt was discovered that the bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle HCI device initialization failure, leading to a double-free\nvulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3564)\n\nIt was discovered that the bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle HCI device detach events, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3573)\n\nIt was discovered that the NFC implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle failed connect events leading to a NULL pointer\ndereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2021-3587)\n",
