                "description": "Adam Nichols discovered that heap overflows existed in the iSCSI subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-27365)  Adam Nichols discovered that the iSCSI subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict access to iSCSI transport handles. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or expose sensitive information (kernel pointer addresses). (CVE-2021-27363)  Adam Nichols discovered that an out-of-bounds read existed in the iSCSI subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2021-27364)",
