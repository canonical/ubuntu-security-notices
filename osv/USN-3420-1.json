  "summary": "linux, linux-aws, linux-gke, linux-kvm, linux-raspi2, linux-snapdragon vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the Bluetooth stack of\nthe Linux kernel when handling L2CAP configuration responses. A physically\nproximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2017-1000251)\n\nIt was discovered that the Flash-Friendly File System (f2fs) implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not properly validate superblock metadata. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-10663)\n\nIt was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ioctl handling code\nin the ISDN subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2017-12762)\n\nPengfei Wang discovered that a race condition existed in the NXP SAA7164 TV\nDecoder driver for the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2017-8831)\n",
