  "details": "Kiyin (\u5c39\u4eae) discovered that the NFC LLCP protocol implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a reference counting error. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-25670)\n\nKiyin (\u5c39\u4eae) discovered that the NFC LLCP protocol implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error\nsituations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(memory exhaustion). (CVE-2020-25671, CVE-2020-25672)\n\nKiyin (\u5c39\u4eae) discovered that the NFC LLCP protocol implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle error conditions in some situations,\nleading to an infinite loop. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2020-25673)\n\nIt was discovered that the Xen paravirtualization backend in the Linux\nkernel did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2021-28688)\n\nIt was discovered that the fuse user space file system implementation in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly handle bad inodes in some situations. A\nlocal attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2021-28950)\n\nZygo Blaxell discovered that the btrfs file system implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a race condition during certain cloning operations.\nA local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2021-28964)\n\nVince Weaver discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle certain PEBS records properly for some Intel Haswell\nprocessors. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2021-28971)\n\nIt was discovered that the RPA PCI Hotplug driver implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle device name writes via sysfs, leading\nto a buffer overflow. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2021-28972)\n\nIt was discovered that the Freescale Gianfar Ethernet driver for the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle receive queue overrun when jumbo frames were\nenabled in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2021-29264)\n\nIt was discovered that the Qualcomm IPC router implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly initialize memory passed to user space. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2021-29647)\n\nDan Carpenter discovered that the block device manager (dm) implementation\nin the Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow in the ioctl for listing\ndevices. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2021-31916)\n\n\u9a6c\u54f2\u5b87 discovered that the IEEE 1394 (Firewire) nosy packet sniffer driver in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some\nsituations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3483)\n\n",
