  "details": "Quentin Minster discovered that a race condition existed in the KSMBD\nimplementation in the Linux kernel when handling sessions operations. A\nremote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-32250, CVE-2023-32252,\nCVE-2023-32257)\n\nMarek Marczykowski-G\u00f3recki discovered that the Xen event channel\ninfrastructure implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race\ncondition. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a\ndenial of service (paravirtualized device unavailability). (CVE-2023-34324)\n\nZheng Wang discovered a use-after-free in the Renesas Ethernet AVB driver\nin the Linux kernel during device removal. A privileged attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-35827)\n\nTom Dohrmann discovered that the Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV)\nimplementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel contained a race\ncondition when accessing MMIO registers. A local attacker in a SEV guest VM\ncould possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-46813)\n\nIt was discovered that the Microchip USB Ethernet driver in the Linux\nkernel contained a race condition during device removal, leading to a use-\nafter-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-6039)\n\nLin Ma discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly validate network family support while creating a new netfilter\ntable. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-6040)\n\nIt was discovered that the TLS subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly perform cryptographic operations in some situations, leading to a\nnull pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2023-6176)\n\nIt was discovered that the CIFS network file system implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate the server frame size in certain\nsituation, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. An attacker\ncould use this to construct a malicious CIFS image that, when operated on,\ncould cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2023-6606)\n\nXingyuan Mo discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle dynset expressions passed from userspace, leading to a\nnull pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-6622)\n\nXingyuan Mo discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle inactive elements in its PIPAPO data structure, leading\nto a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause\na denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-6817)\n\nBudimir Markovic, Lucas De Marchi, and Pengfei Xu discovered that the perf\nsubsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate all event sizes\nwhen attaching new events, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability.\nA local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-6931)\n\nIt was discovered that the IGMP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel\ncontained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-6932)\n\nKevin Rich discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly check deactivated elements in certain situations, leading to a\nuse-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2024-0193)\n\nIt was discovered that the TIPC protocol implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly handle locking during tipc_crypto_key_revoke() operations.\nA local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel\ndeadlock).
