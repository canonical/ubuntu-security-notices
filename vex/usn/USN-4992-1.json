An attacker could use this to bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. (CVE-2020-14372)  Chris Coulson discovered that the rmmod command in GRUB 2 contained a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. (CVE-2020-25632)  Chris Coulson discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the command line parser in GRUB 2. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. (CVE-2020-27749)  It was discovered that the cutmem command in GRUB 2 did not honor secure boot locking. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. (CVE-2020-27779)  It was discovered that the option parser in GRUB 2 contained a heap overflow vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. (CVE-2021-20225)  It was discovered that the menu rendering implementation in GRUB 2 did not properly calculate the amount of memory needed in some situations, leading to out-of-bounds writes. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. (CVE-2021-20233)",
