An attacker could\npossibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2018-11212)\n\nChijin Zhou discovered that Libjpeg6b was incorrectly handling the\nEOF character in input data when generating JPEG files. An attacker\ncould possibly use this issue to force the execution of a large loop,\nforce excessive memory consumption, and cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2018-11813)\n\nSheng Shu and Dongdong She discovered that Libjpeg6b was not properly\nlimiting the amount of memory being used when it was performing\ndecompression or multi-pass compression operations. An attacker could\npossibly use this issue to force excessive memory consumption and\ncause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-14152)\n",
