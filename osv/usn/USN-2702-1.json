  "details": "Gary Kwong, Christian Holler, Byron Campen, Tyson Smith, Bobby Holley,\nChris Coulson, and Eric Rahm discovered multiple memory safety issues in\nFirefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,\nan attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service\nvia application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of\nthe user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-4473, CVE-2015-4474)\n\nAki Helin discovered an out-of-bounds read when playing malformed MP3\ncontent in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a\nspecially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\nobtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service via application\ncrash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking\nFirefox. (CVE-2015-4475)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered during MediaStream playback in some\ncircumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\nwebsite, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of\nservice via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the\npriviliges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-4477)\n\nAndr\u00e9 Bargull discovered that non-configurable properties on javascript\nobjects could be redefined when parsing JSON. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to bypass same-origin restrictions. (CVE-2015-4478)\n\nMultiple integer overflows were discovered in libstagefright. If a user\nwere tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application\ncrash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking\nFirefox. (CVE-2015-4479, CVE-2015-4480, CVE-2015-4493)\n\nJukka Jyl\u00e4nki discovered a crash that occurs because javascript does not\nproperly gate access to Atomics or SharedArrayBuffers in some\ncircumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\nwebsite, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2015-4484)\n\nAbhishek Arya discovered 2 buffer overflows in libvpx when decoding\nmalformed WebM content in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in\nto opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\nexploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or\nexecute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.\n(CVE-2015-4485, CVE-2015-4486)\n\nRonald Crane reported 3 security issues. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\nexploit these, in combination with another security vulnerability, to\ncause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-4487,\nCVE-2015-4488, CVE-2015-4489)\n\nChristoph Kerschbaumer discovered an issue with Mozilla's implementation\nof Content Security Policy (CSP), which could allow for a more permissive\nusage in some cirucumstances. An attacker could potentially exploit this\nto conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2015-4490)\n\nGustavo Grieco discovered a heap overflow in gdk-pixbuf. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application\ncrash or execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the user invoking\nFirefox. (CVE-2015-4491)\n\nLooben Yang discovered a use-after-free when using XMLHttpRequest with\nshared workers in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening\na specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\ncause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code\nwith the priviliges of the user invoking Firefox.
