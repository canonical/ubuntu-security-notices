                "description": "It was discovered that the Upper Level Protocol (ULP) subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle sockets entering the LISTEN state in certain protocols, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-0461)  Davide Ornaghi discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle VLAN headers in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-0179)  It was discovered that the NVMe driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle reset events in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3169)  Maxim Levitsky discovered that the KVM nested virtualization (SVM) implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel did not properly handle nested shutdown execution. An attacker in a guest vm could use this to cause a denial of service (host kernel crash) (CVE-2022-3344)  Gwangun Jung discovered a race condition in the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel when deleting multipath routes, resulting in an out-of-bounds read. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-3435)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Kernel Connection Multiplexor (KCM) socket implementation in the Linux kernel when releasing sockets in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3521)  It was discovered that the Netronome Ethernet driver in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3545)  It was discovered that the Intel i915 graphics driver in the Linux kernel did not perform a GPU TLB flush in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-4139)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Xen network backend driver in the Linux kernel when handling dropped packets in certain circumstances. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). (CVE-2022-42328, CVE-2022-42329)  It was discovered that the NFSD implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-4379)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the x86 KVM subsystem implementation in the Linux kernel when nested virtualization and the TDP MMU are enabled. An attacker in a guest vm could use this to cause a denial of service (host OS crash). (CVE-2022-45869)  It was discovered that the Atmel WILC1000 driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the number of channels, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-47518)  It was discovered that the Atmel WILC1000 driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate specific attributes, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-47519)  It was discovered that the Atmel WILC1000 driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate offsets, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-47520)  It was discovered that the Atmel WILC1000 driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate specific attributes, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-47521)  Lin Ma discovered a race condition in the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-0468)  It was discovered that the file system writeback functionality in the Linux kernel contained a user-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-26605)",
