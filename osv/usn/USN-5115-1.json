  "details": "It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Atheros Ath9k WiFi\ndriver in the Linux kernel. An attacker could possibly use this to expose\nsensitive information (WiFi network traffic). (CVE-2020-3702)\n\nOfek Kirzner, Adam Morrison, Benedict Schlueter, and Piotr Krysiuk\ndiscovered that the BPF verifier in the Linux kernel missed possible\nmispredicted branches due to type confusion, allowing a side-channel\nattack. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2021-33624)\n\nBenedict Schlueter discovered that the BPF subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly protect against Speculative Store Bypass (SSB) side-\nchannel attacks in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use\nthis to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-34556)\n\nPiotr Krysiuk discovered that the BPF subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly protect against Speculative Store Bypass (SSB) side-channel\nattacks in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to\nexpose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-35477)\n\nIt was discovered that the tracing subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly keep track of per-cpu ring buffer state. A privileged attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2021-3679)\n\nIt was discovered that the Option USB High Speed Mobile device driver in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly handle error conditions. A physically\nproximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-37159)\n\nAlois Wohlschlager discovered that the overlay file system in the Linux\nkernel did not restrict private clones in some situations. An attacker\ncould use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-3732)\n\nIt was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle removing a non-existent device id. An attacker with\nCAP_SYS_ADMIN could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2021-3739)\n\nIt was discovered that the Qualcomm IPC Router protocol implementation in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly validate metadata in some situations. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-3743)\n\nIt was discovered that the virtual terminal (vt) device implementation in\nthe Linux kernel contained a race condition in its ioctl handling that led\nto an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use\nthis to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-3753)\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly account for the\nmemory usage of certain IPC objects. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-3759)\n\nIt was discovered that the BPF subsystem in the Linux kernel contained an\ninteger overflow in its hash table implementation. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2021-38166)\n\nIt was discovered that the MAX-3421 host USB device driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle device removal events. A physically\nproximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2021-38204)\n\nIt was discovered that the Xilinx 10/100 Ethernet Lite device driver in the\nLinux kernel could report pointer addresses in some situations. An attacker\ncould use this information to ease the exploitation of another\nvulnerability. (CVE-2021-38205)\n\nIt was discovered that the ext4 file system in the Linux kernel contained a\nrace condition when writing xattrs to an inode. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service or possibly gain administrative\nprivileges. (CVE-2021-40490)\n\nIt was discovered that the 6pack network protocol driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly perform validation checks. A privileged attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2021-42008)\n",
