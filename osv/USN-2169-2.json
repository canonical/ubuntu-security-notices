  "details": "USN-2169-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Django. The upstream security patch\nfor CVE-2014-0472 introduced a regression for certain applications. This\nupdate fixes the problem.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Benjamin Bach discovered that Django incorrectly handled dotted Python\n paths when using the reverse() function. An attacker could use this issue\n to cause Django to import arbitrary modules from the Python path, resulting\n in possible code execution. (CVE-2014-0472)\n \n Paul McMillan discovered that Django incorrectly cached certain pages that\n contained CSRF cookies. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to obtain\n a valid cookie and perform attacks which bypass the CSRF restrictions.\n (CVE-2014-0473)\n \n Michael Koziarski discovered that Django did not always perform explicit\n conversion of certain fields when using a MySQL database. An attacker\n could possibly use this issue to obtain unexpected results. (CVE-2014-0474)\n",
