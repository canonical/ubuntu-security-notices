  "summary": "linux-aws-5.19, linux-gcp-5.19, linux-hwe-5.19 vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly check buffer indexes in certain situations, leading\nto an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use\nthis to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-48502)\n\nStonejiajia, Shir Tamari and Sagi Tzadik discovered that the OverlayFS\nimplementation in the Ubuntu Linux kernel did not properly perform\npermission checks in certain situations. A local attacker could possibly\nuse this to gain elevated privileges. (CVE-2023-2640)\n\nIt was discovered that the IP-VLAN network driver for the Linux kernel did\nnot properly initialize memory in some situations, leading to an out-of-\nbounds write vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3090)\n\nMingi Cho discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly validate the status of a nft chain while performing a lookup\nby id, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2023-31248)\n\nIt was discovered that the Ricoh R5C592 MemoryStick card reader driver in\nthe Linux kernel contained a race condition during module unload, leading\nto a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause\na denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-3141)\n\nShir Tamari and Sagi Tzadik discovered that the OverlayFS implementation in\nthe Ubuntu Linux kernel did not properly perform permission checks in\ncertain situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain\nelevated privileges. (CVE-2023-32629)\n\nQuerijn Voet discovered that a race condition existed in the io_uring\nsubsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3389)\n\nIt was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle some error conditions, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3390)\n\nTanguy Dubroca discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly handle certain pointer data type, leading to an out-of-\nbounds write vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-35001)\n\n",
