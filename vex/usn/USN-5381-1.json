                "description": "David Bouman discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate passed user register indices. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1015)  It was discovered that the block layer subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory in some situations. A privileged local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-0494)  It was discovered that the DMA subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly ensure bounce buffers were completely overwritten by the DMA device. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-0854)  Jann Horn discovered that the FUSE file system in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1011)  David Bouman discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not initialize memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-1016)  Hu Jiahui discovered that multiple race conditions existed in the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework, leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could use these to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1048)  It was discovered that the USB Gadget file system interface in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-24958)  It was discovered that the ST21NFCA NFC driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the size of certain data in EVT_TRANSACTION events. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-26490)  It was discovered that the USB SR9700 ethernet device driver for the Linux kernel did not properly validate the length of requests from the device. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-26966)  It was discovered that the Xilinx USB2 device gadget driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate endpoint indices from the host. A physically proximate attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-27223)  \u8d75\u5b50\u8f69 discovered that the 802.2 LLC type 2 driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-28356)",
