  "details": "It was discovered that the ADIS16400 IIO IMU Driver for the Linux kernel\ndid not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2019-19060)\n\nIt was discovered that the vhost net driver in the Linux kernel contained a\nstack buffer overflow. A local attacker with the ability to perform ioctl()\ncalls on /dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2020-10942)\n\nIt was discovered that the Serial CAN interface driver in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly initialize data. A local attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-11494)\n\nIt was discovered that the linux kernel did not properly validate certain\nmount options to the tmpfs virtual memory file system. A local attacker\nwith the ability to specify mount options could use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash). (CVE-2020-11565)\n\nIt was discovered that the OV51x USB Camera device driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2020-11608)\n\nIt was discovered that the STV06XX USB Camera device driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2020-11609)\n\nIt was discovered that the Xirlink C-It USB Camera device driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically\nproximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2020-11668)\n",
