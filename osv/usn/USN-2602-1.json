  "details": "Jesse Ruderman, Mats Palmgren, Byron Campen, Steve Fink, Gary Kwong,\nAndrew McCreight, Christian Holler, Jon Coppeard, and Milan Sreckovic\ndiscovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application\ncrash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking\nFirefox. (CVE-2015-2708, CVE-2015-2709)\n\nAtte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow during the rendering of SVG\ncontent with certain CSS properties in some circumstances. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application\ncrash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking\nFirefox. (CVE-2015-2710)\n\nAlex Verstak discovered that <meta name=\"referrer\"> is ignored in some\ncircumstances. (CVE-2015-2711)\n\nDougall Johnson discovered an out of bounds read and write in asm.js.

(CVE-2015-2712)\n\nScott Bell discovered a use-afer-free during the processing of text when\nvertical text is enabled. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially\ncrafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a\ndenial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with\nthe privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-2713)\n\nTyson Smith and Jesse Schwartzentruber discovered a use-after-free during\nshutdown. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of\nservice via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-2715)\n\nUcha Gobejishvili discovered a buffer overflow when parsing compressed XML\ncontent. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,\nan attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service\nvia application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of\nthe user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-2716)\n\nA buffer overflow and out-of-bounds read were discovered when parsing\nmetadata in MP4 files in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.\n(CVE-2015-2717)\n\nMark Hammond discovered that when a trusted page is hosted within an\niframe in an untrusted page, the untrusted page can intercept webchannel\nresponses meant for the trusted page in some circumstances. If a user\nwere tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\nexploit this to bypass origin restrictions. (CVE-2015-2718)\n",
