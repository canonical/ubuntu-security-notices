                "description": "Joseph Nuzman discovered that some Intel processors did not properly initialise shared resources. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2021-0145)  Mark Ermolov, Dmitry Sklyarov and Maxim Goryachy discovered that some Intel processors did not prevent test and debug logic from being activated at runtime. A local attacker could use this to escalate privileges. (CVE-2021-0146)  It was discovered that some Intel processors did not implement sufficient control flow management. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-0127)  It was discovered that some Intel processors did not completely perform cleanup actions on multi-core shared buffers. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21123, CVE-2022-21127)  It was discovered that some Intel processors did not completely perform cleanup actions on microarchitectural fill buffers. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21125)  Alysa Milburn, Jason Brandt, Avishai Redelman and Nir Lavi discovered that some Intel processors improperly optimised security-critical code. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21151)  It was discovered that some Intel processors did not properly perform cleanup during specific special register write operations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21166)  It was discovered that some Intel processors did not properly restrict access in some situations. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2021-33117)  Brandon Miller discovered that some Intel processors did not properly restrict access in some situations. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive information or a remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-33120)",
