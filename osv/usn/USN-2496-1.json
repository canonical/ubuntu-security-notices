  "details": "Michal Zalewski discovered that the setup_group function in libbfd in\nGNU binutils did not properly check group headers in ELF files. An\nattacker could use this to craft input that could cause a denial\nof service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2014-8485)\n\nHanno B\u00f6ck discovered that the _bfd_XXi_swap_aouthdr_in function\nin libbfd in GNU binutils allowed out-of-bounds writes. An\nattacker could use this to craft input that could cause a denial\nof service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2014-8501)\n\nHanno B\u00f6ck discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the\npe_print_edata function in libbfd in GNU binutils. An attacker\ncould use this to craft input that could cause a denial of service\n(application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-8502)\n\nAlexander Cherepanov discovered multiple directory traversal\nvulnerabilities in GNU binutils. An attacker could use this to craft\ninput that could delete arbitrary files. (CVE-2014-8737)\n\nAlexander Cherepanov discovered the _bfd_slurp_extended_name_table\nfunction in libbfd in GNU binutils allowed invalid writes when handling\nextended name tables in an archive. An attacker could use this to\ncraft input that could cause a denial of service (application crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-8738)\n\nHanno B\u00f6ck discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the ihex_scan\nfunction in libbfd in GNU binutils. An attacker could use this\nto craft input that could cause a denial of service (application\ncrash). (CVE-2014-8503)\n\nMichal Zalewski discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the\nsrec_scan function in libbfd in GNU binutils. An attacker could\nuse this to to craft input that could cause a denial of service\n(application crash); the GNU C library's Fortify Source printf\nprotection should prevent the possibility of executing arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2014-8504)\n\nMichal Zalewski discovered that the srec_scan function in libbfd\nin GNU binutils allowed out-of-bounds reads. An attacker could\nuse this to craft input to cause a denial of service. This issue\nonly affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 10.04\nLTS. (CVE-2014-8484)\n\nSang Kil Cha discovered multiple integer overflows in the\n_objalloc_alloc function and objalloc_alloc macro in binutils. This\ncould allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (application\ncrash). This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.\n(CVE-2012-3509)\n\nAlexander Cherepanov and Hanno B\u00f6ck discovered multiple additional\nout-of-bounds reads and writes in GNU binutils. An attacker could use\nthese to craft input that could cause a denial of service (application\ncrash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. A few of these issues may\nbe limited in exposure to a denial of service (application abort)\nby the GNU C library's Fortify Source printf protection.\n\nThe strings(1) utility in GNU binutils used libbfd by default when\nexamining executable object files; unfortunately, libbfd was not\noriginally developed with the expectation of hostile input. As\na defensive measure, the behavior of strings has been changed to\ndefault to 'strings --all' behavior, which does not use libbfd; use\nthe new argument to strings, '--data', to recreate the old behavior.\n",
