  "summary": "openssl vulnerabilities",
  "details": "Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL used undefined behaviour when\nperforming pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use this\nissue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This\nissue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS as other\nreleases were fixed in a previous security update. (CVE-2016-2177)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenSSL did not properly handle Montgomery\nmultiplication, resulting in incorrect results leading to transient\nfailures. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 16.10.\n(CVE-2016-7055)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenSSL did not properly use constant-time\noperations when performing ECDSA P-256 signing. A remote attacker could\npossibly use this issue to perform a timing attack and recover private\nECDSA keys. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04\nLTS. (CVE-2016-7056)\n\nShi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain warning alerts.\nA remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to stop\nresponding, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-8610)\n\nRobert \u015awi\u0119cki discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain\ntruncated packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause\nOpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2017-3731)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly performed the x86_64 Montgomery\nsquaring procedure. While unlikely, a remote attacker could possibly use\nthis issue to recover private keys. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 16.04\nLTS, and Ubuntu 16.10. (CVE-2017-3732)\n",
