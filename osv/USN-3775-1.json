  "details": "It was discovered that the paravirtualization implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle some indirect calls, reducing the\neffectiveness of Spectre v2 mitigations for paravirtual guests. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-15594)\n\nIt was discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and\nprediction of return addresses via Return Stack Buffer (RSB) may allow\nunauthorized memory reads via sidechannel attacks. An attacker could use\nthis to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-15572)\n\nIt was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the\nLinux kernel when loading an executable to run. A local attacker could use\nthis to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2018-14634)\n\nIt was discovered that a stack-based buffer overflow existed in the iSCSI\ntarget implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-14633)\n\nIt was discovered that a memory leak existed in the IRDA subsystem of the\nLinux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2018-6554)\n\nIt was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the IRDA\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2018-6555)\n\n",
