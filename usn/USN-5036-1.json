  "description": "It was discovered that Tor incorrectly handled certain memory operations. A\nremote attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue\nonly affected Ubuntu 18.04 ESM. (CVE-2019-8955)\n\nIt was discovered that Tor did not properly handle the input length to\ndump_desc() function. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause a denial\nof service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 ESM, Ubuntu 18.04 ESM and\nUbuntu 20.04 ESM. (CVE-2021-28089)\n\nIt was discovered that Tor did not properly sanitize the relay nickname in\ndirvote_add_signatures_to_pending_consensus() function. An attacker could\npossibly use this issue to cause an assertion failure and then cause a denial\nof service. (CVE-2021-28090)\n\nIt was discovered that Tor did not properly validate the layer hint on\nhalf-open streams. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass\nthe access control, leading to remote code execution. This issue only affected\nUbuntu 20.04 ESM. (CVE-2021-34548)\n\nIt was discovered that Tor was using an insecure hash function. A remote\nattacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only\naffected Ubuntu 16.04 ESM, Ubuntu 18.04 ESM and Ubuntu 20.04 ESM.\n(CVE-2021-34549)\n\nIt was discovered that Tor did not properly manage memory under certain\ncircumstances. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted request,\na remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a crash, resulting in\na denial of service, or possibly reading sensitive data. This issue only\naffected Ubuntu 18.04 ESM and Ubuntu 20.04 ESM. (CVE-2021-34550)\n\nIt was discovered that Tor mishandles the relationship between batch-signature\nverification and single-signature verification. An attacker could possibly use\nthis issue to cause an assertion failure and then cause a denial of service.\nThis issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 ESM, Ubuntu 18.04 ESM and Ubuntu 20.04\nESM.
