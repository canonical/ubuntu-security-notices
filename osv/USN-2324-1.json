A remove authenticated attacker could use this to\ngain privileges by creating a new token with additional roles.\n(CVE-2014-3476)\n\nJamie Lennox discovered that OpenStack Keystone did not properly validate\nthe project id. A remote authenticated attacker may be able to use this to\naccess other projects. (CVE-2014-3520)\n\nBrant Knudson and Lance Bragstad discovered that OpenStack Keystone would\nnot always revoke tokens correctly. If Keystone were configured to use\nrevocation events, a remote authenticated attacker could continue to have\naccess to resources. (CVE-2014-5251, CVE-2014-5252, CVE-2014-5253)\n",
