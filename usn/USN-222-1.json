  "description": "Jack Louis of Dyad Security discovered that Perl did not sufficiently\ncheck the explicit length argument in format strings. Specially\ncrafted format strings with overly large length arguments led to a\ncrash of the Perl interpreter or even to execution of arbitrary\nattacker-defined code with the privileges of the user running the Perl\nprogram.\n\nHowever, this attack was only possible in insecure Perl programs which\nuse variables with user-defined values in string interpolations\nwithout checking their validity.",
