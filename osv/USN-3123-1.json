  "summary": "curl vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that curl incorrectly reused client certificates when\nbuilt with NSS. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to hijack\nthe authentication of a TLS connection. (CVE-2016-7141)\n\nNguyen Vu Hoang discovered that curl incorrectly handled escaping certain\nstrings. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2016-7167)\n\nIt was discovered that curl incorrectly handled storing cookies. A remote\nattacker could possibly use this issue to inject cookies for arbitrary\ndomains in the cookie jar. (CVE-2016-8615)\n\nIt was discovered that curl incorrect handled case when comparing user\nnames and passwords. A remote attacker with knowledge of a case-insensitive\nversion of the correct password could possibly use this issue to cause\na connection to be reused. (CVE-2016-8616)\n\nIt was discovered that curl incorrect handled memory when encoding to\nbase64. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2016-8617)\n\nIt was discovered that curl incorrect handled memory when preparing\nformatted output. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause\ncurl to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2016-8618)\n\nIt was discovered that curl incorrect handled memory when performing\nKerberos authentication. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to\ncause curl to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2016-8619)\n\nLu\u1eadt Nguy\u1ec5n discovered that curl incorrectly handled parsing globs. A\nremote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to crash,\nresulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This\nissue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.10.\n(CVE-2016-8620)\n\nLu\u1eadt Nguy\u1ec5n discovered that curl incorrectly handled converting dates. A\nremote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to crash,\nresulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-8621)\n\nIt was discovered that curl incorrectly handled URL percent-encoding\ndecoding. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2016-8622)\n\nIt was discovered that curl incorrectly handled shared cookies. A remote\nserver could possibly obtain incorrect cookies or other sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2016-8623)\n\nFernando Mu\u00f1oz discovered that curl incorrect parsed certain URLs. A remote\nattacker could possibly use this issue to trick curl into connecting to a\ndifferent host.
