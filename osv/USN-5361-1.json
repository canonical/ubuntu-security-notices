  "details": "It was discovered that the VFIO PCI driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle attempts to access disabled memory spaces. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2020-12888)\n\nMathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel\u2019s WiFi implementation did\nnot properly verify certain fragmented frames. A physically proximate\nattacker could possibly use this issue to inject or decrypt packets.\n(CVE-2020-26141)\n\nMathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel\u2019s WiFi implementation\naccepted plaintext fragments in certain situations. A physically proximate\nattacker could use this issue to inject packets. (CVE-2020-26145)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Atheros Ath9k WiFi\ndriver in the Linux kernel. An attacker could possibly use this to expose\nsensitive information (WiFi network traffic). (CVE-2020-3702)\n\nIt was discovered a race condition existed in the Unix domain socket\nimplementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-0920)\n\nIt was discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel\ncontained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2021-0935)\n\nZygo Blaxell discovered that the btrfs file system implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a race condition during certain cloning operations.\nA local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2021-28964)\n\nDan Carpenter discovered that the block device manager (dm) implementation\nin the Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow in the ioctl for listing\ndevices. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2021-31916)\n\nIt was discovered that the Option USB High Speed Mobile device driver in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly handle error conditions. A physically\nproximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-37159)\n\nIt was discovered that the network packet filtering implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly initialize information in certain\ncircumstances. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation (kernel memory). (CVE-2021-39636)\n\nJann Horn discovered a race condition in the Unix domain socket\nimplementation in the Linux kernel that could result in a read-after-free.\nA local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-4083)\n\nLuo Likang discovered that the FireDTV Firewire driver in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-42739)\n\nBrendan Dolan-Gavitt discovered that the Marvell WiFi-Ex USB device driver\nin the Linux kernel did not properly handle some error conditions. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2021-43976)\n\nAmit Klein discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel\ncould disclose internal state in some situations. An attacker could\npossibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-45486)\n\n",
