This update caused several\nweb compatibility regressions.\n\nThis update fixes the problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Francis Gabriel discovered a buffer overflow during ASN.1 decoding in NSS.\n If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an\n attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via\n application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\n user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2016-1950)\n \n Bob Clary, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, Daniel\n Holbert, Jesse Ruderman, Randell Jesup, Carsten Book, Gian-Carlo Pascutto,\n Tyson Smith, Andrea Marchesini, and Jukka Jyl\u00e4nki discovered multiple\n memory safety issues in Firefox.

(CVE-2016-1952,\n CVE-2016-1953)\n \n Nicolas Golubovic discovered that CSP violation reports can be used to\n overwrite local files. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially\n crafted website with addon signing disabled and unpacked addons installed,\n an attacker could potentially exploit this to gain additional privileges.\n (CVE-2016-1954)\n \n Muneaki Nishimura discovered that CSP violation reports contained full\n paths for cross-origin iframe navigations. An attacker could potentially\n exploit this to steal confidential data. (CVE-2016-1955)\n \n Ucha Gobejishvili discovered that performing certain WebGL operations\n resulted in memory resource exhaustion with some Intel GPUs, requiring\n a reboot. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\n website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial\n of service. (CVE-2016-1956)\n \n Jose Martinez and Romina Santillan discovered a memory leak in\n libstagefright during MPEG4 video file processing in some circumstances.\n If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an\n attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via\n memory exhaustion. (CVE-2016-1957)\n \n Abdulrahman Alqabandi discovered that the addressbar could be blank or\n filled with page defined content in some circumstances. If a user were\n tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\n potentially exploit this to conduct URL spoofing attacks. (CVE-2016-1958)\n \n Looben Yang discovered an out-of-bounds read in Service Worker Manager. If\n a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker\n could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via\n application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\n user invoking Firefox.

(CVE-2016-1964)\n \n Tsubasa Iinuma discovered a mechanism to cause the addressbar to display\n an incorrect URL, using history navigations and the Location protocol\n property. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\n website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct URL\n spoofing attacks. (CVE-2016-1965)\n \n A memory corruption issues was discovered in the NPAPI subsystem. If\n a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website with a\n malicious plugin installed, an attacker could potentially exploit this\n to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary\n code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2016-1966)\n \n Jordi Chancel discovered a same-origin-policy bypass when using\n performance.getEntries and history navigation with session restore. If\n a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker\n could potentially exploit this to steal confidential data. (CVE-2016-1967)\n \n Luke Li discovered a buffer overflow during Brotli decompression in some\n circumstances.
