  "summary": "linux, linux-aws, linux-kvm, linux-lts-xenial, linux-raspi2, linux-snapdragon vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the Kvaser CAN/USB driver in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly initialize memory in certain situations. A local attacker\ncould possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2019-19947)\n\nChuhong Yuan discovered that go7007 USB audio device driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly deallocate memory in some failure conditions. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-20810)\n\nJason A. Donenfeld discovered that the ACPI implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly restrict loading SSDT code from an EFI variable. A\nprivileged attacker could use this to bypass Secure Boot lockdown\nrestrictions and execute arbitrary code in the kernel. (CVE-2019-20908)\n\nIt was discovered that the elf handling code in the Linux kernel did not\ninitialize memory before using it in certain situations. A local attacker\ncould use this to possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2020-10732)\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel did not correctly apply Speculative\nStore Bypass Disable (SSBD) mitigations in certain situations. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2020-10766)\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel did not correctly apply Indirect\nBranch Predictor Barrier (IBPB) mitigations in certain situations. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2020-10767)\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel could incorrectly enable Indirect\nBranch Speculation after it has been disabled for a process via a prctl()\ncall. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2020-10768)\n\nMauricio Faria de Oliveira discovered that the aufs implementation in the\nLinux kernel improperly managed inode reference counts in the\nvfsub_dentry_open() method. A local attacker could use this vulnerability\nto cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-11935)\n\nIt was discovered that the Virtual Terminal keyboard driver in the Linux\nkernel contained an integer overflow. A local attacker could possibly use\nthis to have an unspecified impact. (CVE-2020-13974)\n\nIt was discovered that the efi subsystem in the Linux kernel did not handle\nmemory allocation failures during early boot in some situations. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2019-12380)\n",
