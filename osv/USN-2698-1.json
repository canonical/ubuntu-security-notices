This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2013-7443)\n\nMichal Zalewski discovered that SQLite incorrectly handled dequoting of\ncollation-sequence names. An attacker could use this issue to cause\napplications using SQLite to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\nand Ubuntu 15.04. (CVE-2015-3414)\n\nMichal Zalewski discovered that SQLite incorrectly implemented comparison\noperators. An attacker could use this issue to cause applications using\nSQLite to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute\narbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 15.04.
