  "details": "Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle corrupted meta data in some situations. An\nattacker could use this to specially craft an ext4 file system that caused\na denial of service (system crash) when mounted. (CVE-2018-1092)\n\nIt was discovered that the 802.11 software simulator implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a memory leak when handling certain error\nconditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of\nservice (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2018-8087)\n\nIt was discovered that a memory leak existed in the Serial Attached SCSI\n(SAS) implementation in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2018-10021)\n",
