  "details": "USN-2948-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Ubuntu 14.10 Linux kernel\nbackported to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. An incorrect reference counting\nfix in the radeon driver introduced a regression that could cause a\nsystem crash. This update fixes the problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the\n Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the\n device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service\n (system crash). (CVE-2015-7566)\n \n Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the usbvision driver in the Linux kernel\n did not properly validate the interfaces and endpoints reported by the\n device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service\n (system crash). (CVE-2015-7833)\n \n Venkatesh Pottem discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux\n kernel's CXGB3 driver. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\n service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-8812)\n \n It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ioctl handler for\n the TTY driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\n cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.\n (CVE-2016-0723)\n \n Xiaofei Rex Guo discovered a timing side channel vulnerability in the Linux\n Extended Verification Module (EVM). An attacker could use this to affect\n system integrity. (CVE-2016-2085)\n \n David Herrmann discovered that the Linux kernel incorrectly accounted file\n descriptors to the original opener for in-flight file descriptors sent over\n a unix domain socket. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\n service (resource exhaustion). (CVE-2016-2550)\n \n Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Treo devices in the\n Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the\n device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service\n (system crash). (CVE-2016-2782)\n \n It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not enforce limits on the\n amount of data allocated to buffer pipes. A local attacker could use this\n to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion). (CVE-2016-2847)\n",
