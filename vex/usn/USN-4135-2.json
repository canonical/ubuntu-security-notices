                "description": "Peter Pi discovered a buffer overflow in the virtio network backend (vhost_net) implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker in a guest may be able to use this to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code in the host OS. (CVE-2019-14835)  It was discovered that the Linux kernel on PowerPC architectures did not properly handle Facility Unavailable exceptions in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-15030)  It was discovered that the Linux kernel on PowerPC architectures did not properly handle exceptions on interrupts in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-15031)",
