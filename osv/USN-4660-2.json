  "details": "USN-4660-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel. Unfortunately,\nthat update introduced a regression in the software raid10 driver\nwhen used with fstrim that could lead to data corruption. This update\nfixes the problem.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the perf subsystem of\nthe Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker\nwith access to the perf subsystem could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-14351)\n\nIt was discovered that the frame buffer implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly handle some edge cases in software scrollback. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-14390)\n\nIt was discovered that the netfilter connection tracker for netlink in the\nLinux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2020-25211)\n\nIt was discovered that the Rados block device (rbd) driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly perform privilege checks for access to rbd devices\nin some situations. A local attacker could use this to map or unmap rbd\nblock devices. (CVE-2020-25284)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the hugetlb sysctl\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A privileged attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-25285)\n\nIt was discovered that the block layer subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle zero-length requests. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-25641)\n\nIt was discovered that the HDLC PPP implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly validate input in some situations. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2020-25643)\n\nIt was discovered that the GENEVE tunnel implementation in the Linux kernel\nwhen combined with IPSec did not properly select IP routes in some\nsituations. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information\n(unencrypted network traffic). (CVE-2020-25645)\n\nIt was discovered that the framebuffer implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly perform range checks in certain situations. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2020-28915)\n\nIt was discovered that Power 9 processors could be coerced to expose\ninformation from the L1 cache in certain situations. A local attacker could\nuse this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-4788)\n",
