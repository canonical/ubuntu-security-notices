If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2015-1270)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in the GPU process implementation in\nChromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\nwebsite, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of\nservice via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1272)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in the IndexedDB implementation in\nChromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\nwebsite, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of\nservice via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1276)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in the accessibility implemetation in\nChromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\nwebsite, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of\nservice via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1277)\n\nA memory corruption issue was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked\nin to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\nexploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process.\n(CVE-2015-1280)\n\nIt was discovered that Blink did not properly determine the V8 context of\na microtask in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a\nspecially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\nbypass Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions. (CVE-2015-1281)\n\nMultiple integer overflows were discovered in Expat. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application\ncrash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking\nthe program. (CVE-2015-1283)\n\nIt was discovered that Blink did not enforce a page's maximum number of \nframes in some circumstances, resulting in a use-after-free. If a user\nwere tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash,\nor execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render\nprocess. (CVE-2015-1284)\n\nIt was discovered that the XSS auditor in Blink did not properly choose a\ntruncation point. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\nwebsite, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2015-1285)\n\nAn issue was discovered in the CSS implementation in Blink. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions.\n(CVE-2015-1287)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial\nof service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1289)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in oxide::qt::URLRequestDelegatedJob in\nsome circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially\ncrafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a\ndenial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with\nthe privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1329)\n\nA crash was discovered in the regular expression implementation in V8 in\nsome circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially\ncrafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2015-5605)\n",
