  "details": "It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly clear data\nstructures on context switches for certain Intel graphics processors. A\nlocal attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2019-14615)\n\nIt was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically\nproximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2019-15099)\n\nIt was discovered that the HSA Linux kernel driver for AMD GPU devices did\nnot properly check for errors in certain situations, leading to a NULL\npointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2019-16229)\n\nIt was discovered that the Marvell 8xxx Libertas WLAN device driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly check for errors in certain situations,\nleading to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use\nthis to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-16232)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Virtual Video Test\nDriver in the Linux kernel. An attacker with write access to /dev/video0 on\na system with the vivid module loaded could possibly use this to gain\nadministrative privileges. (CVE-2019-18683)\n\nIt was discovered that the Renesas Digital Radio Interface (DRIF) driver in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly initialize data. A local attacker could\npossibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2019-18786)\n\nIt was discovered that the Sound Open Firmware (SOF) driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory\nexhaustion). (CVE-2019-18811)\n\nIt was discovered that the crypto subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2019-19050, CVE-2019-19062)\n\nIt was discovered that multiple memory leaks existed in the Marvell WiFi-Ex\nDriver for the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to\ncause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19057)\n\nIt was discovered that the Realtek rtlwifi USB device driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A\nlocal attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel\nmemory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19063)\n\nIt was discovered that the RSI 91x WLAN device driver in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory\nexhaustion). (CVE-2019-19071)\n\nIt was discovered that the Broadcom Netxtreme HCA device driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error\nconditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of\nservice (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19077)\n\nIt was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error\nconditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of\nservice (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19078)\n\nIt was discovered that the AMD GPU device drivers in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local\nattacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of service (kernel\nmemory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19082)\n\nIt was discovered that the IO uring implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly perform credentials checks in certain situations. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to gain administrative privileges.\n(CVE-2019-19241)\n\nOr Cohen discovered that the virtual console subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly restrict writes to unimplemented vcsu (unicode) devices. A\nlocal attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or have other unspecified impacts. (CVE-2019-19252)\n\nIt was discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle ioctl requests to get emulated CPUID\nfeatures. An attacker with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-19332)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Linux kernel on x86\nplatforms when keeping track of which process was assigned control of the\nFPU. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory\ncorruption) or possibly gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2019-19602)\n\nIt was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle certain conditions. An attacker could use\nthis to specially craft an ext4 file system that, when mounted, could cause\na denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2019-19767)\n\nIt was discovered that the Kvaser CAN/USB driver in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly initialize memory in certain situations. A local attacker\ncould possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2019-19947)\n\nGao Chuan discovered that the SAS Class driver in the Linux kernel\ncontained a race condition that could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. A\nlocal attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2019-19965)\n\nIt was discovered that the B2C2 FlexCop USB device driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2019-15291)\n",
