  "details": "It was discovered that Synapse network policies could be bypassed via\nspecially crafted URLs. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\nbypass authentication mechanisms. (CVE-2023-32683)\n\nIt was discovered that Synapse exposed cached device information. An\nattacker could possibly use this issue to gain access to sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2023-43796)\n\nIt was discovered that Synapse could be tricked into rejecting state\nchanges in rooms. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause\nSynapse to stop functioning properly, resulting in a denial of service.\nThis issue was only fixed in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.\n(CVE-2022-39374)\n\nIt was discovered that Synapse stored user credentials in a server's\ndatabase temporarily. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\ngain access to sensitive information. This issue was only fixed in\nUbuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2023-41335)\n\nIt was discovered that Synapse could incorrectly respond to server\nauthorization events. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\nbypass authentication mechanisms. This issue was only fixed in Ubuntu\n22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-39335)\n\nIt was discovered that Synapse could be manipulated to mark messages\nas read when they had not been viewed. An attacker could possibly use\nthis issue to perform repudiation-based attacks. This issue was only\nfixed in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2023-42453)\n\nIt was discovered that Synapse had several memory-related issues. An\nattacker could possibly use this issue to cause Synapse to crash,\nresulting in a denial of service. This issue was only fixed in Ubuntu\n22.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-31208)\n\nIt was discovered that Synapse could run external tools due to a\nunchecked thumbnail rendering routine. An attacker could possibly use\nthis issue to cause Synapse to crash, resulting in a denial of service,\nor execute arbitrary code. This issue was only fixed in Ubuntu\n22.04 LTS.
