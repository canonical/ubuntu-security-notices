An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-11212)  Chijin Zhou discovered that Libjpeg6b was incorrectly handling the EOF character in input data when generating JPEG files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to force the execution of a large loop, force excessive memory consumption, and cause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-11813)  Sheng Shu and Dongdong She discovered that Libjpeg6b was not properly limiting the amount of memory being used when it was performing decompression or multi-pass compression operations. An attacker could possibly use this issue to force excessive memory consumption and cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-14152)",
