A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (kernel deadlock). (CVE-2022-4269)\n\nIt was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly check buffer indexes in certain situations, leading\nto an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use\nthis to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-48502)\n\nSeth Jenkins discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly perform\naddress randomization for a per-cpu memory management structure. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory)\nor in conjunction with another kernel vulnerability.
