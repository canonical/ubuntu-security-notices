        "description": "A carefully crafted invocation on the Image plugin could trigger an CSRF vulnerability on Apache JSPWiki before 2.11.3, which could allow a group privilege escalation of the attacker's account. Further examination of this issue established that it could also be used to modify the email associated with the attacked account, and then a reset password request from the login page.",
