  "summary": "linux-aws, linux-kvm, linux-raspi2, linux-snapdragon vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the LIO SCSI target implementation in the Linux\nkernel performed insufficient identifier checking in certain XCOPY\nrequests. An attacker with access to at least one LUN in a multiple\nbackstore environment could use this to expose sensitive information or\nmodify data. (CVE-2020-28374)\n\nWen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly track inode validations. An attacker could use this\nto construct a malicious XFS image that, when mounted, could cause a denial\nof service (system crash). (CVE-2018-13093)\n\nIt was discovered that the btrfs file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate file system metadata in some situations.\nAn attacker could use this to construct a malicious btrfs image that, when\nmounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-19813,\nCVE-2019-19816)\n\nBodong Zhao discovered a use-after-free in the Sun keyboard driver\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2020-25669)\n",
