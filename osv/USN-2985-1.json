  "summary": "eglibc, glibc vulnerabilities",
  "details": "Martin Carpenter discovered that pt_chown in the GNU C Library did not\nproperly check permissions for tty files. A local attacker could use this\nto gain administrative privileges or expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2013-2207, CVE-2016-2856)\n\nRobin Hack discovered that the Name Service Switch (NSS) implementation in\nthe GNU C Library did not properly manage its file descriptors. An attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (infinite loop).\n(CVE-2014-8121)\n\nJoseph Myers discovered that the GNU C Library did not properly handle long\narguments to functions returning a representation of Not a Number (NaN). An\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (stack exhaustion\nleading to an application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2014-9761)\n\nArjun Shankar discovered that in certain situations the nss_dns code in the\nGNU C Library did not properly account buffer sizes when passed an\nunaligned buffer. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-1781)\n\nSumit Bose and Lukas Slebodnik discovered that the Name Service\nSwitch (NSS) implementation in the GNU C Library did not handle long\nlines in the files databases correctly. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-5277)\n\nAdam Nielsen discovered that the strftime function in the GNU C Library did\nnot properly handle out-of-range argument data. An attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2015-8776)\n\nHector Marco and Ismael Ripoll discovered that the GNU C Library allowed\nthe pointer-guarding protection mechanism to be disabled by honoring the\nLD_POINTER_GUARD environment variable across privilege boundaries. A local\nattacker could use this to exploit an existing vulnerability more easily.\n(CVE-2015-8777)\n\nSzabolcs Nagy discovered that the hcreate functions in the GNU C Library\ndid not properly check its size argument, leading to an integer overflow.\nAn attacker could use to cause a denial of service (application crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-8778)\n\nMaksymilian Arciemowicz discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the\ncatopen function in the GNU C Library when handling long catalog names. An\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-8779)\n\nFlorian Weimer discovered that the getnetbyname implementation in the GNU C\nLibrary did not properly handle long names passed as arguments. An attacker\ncould use to cause a denial of service (stack exhaustion leading to an\napplication crash). (CVE-2016-3075)\n",
