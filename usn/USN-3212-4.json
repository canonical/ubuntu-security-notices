  "description": "USN-3212-1 fixed several issues in LibTIFF. This update\nprovides a subset of corresponding update for Ubuntu 12.04 ESM.\n\nMei Wang discovered a multiple integer overflows in LibTIFF which\nallows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or\nexecute arbitrary code via a crafted TIFF image, which triggers\nan out-of-bounds write. (CVE-2016-3945)\n\nIt was discovered that LibTIFF is vulnerable to a heap buffer\noverflow in the resulting in DoS or code execution\nvia a crafted BitsPerSample value. (CVE-2017-5225)\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that LibTIFF incorrectly handled certain malformed\n images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially\n crafted image, a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a\n denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges.\n",
