  "details": "USN-3747-1 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenJDK 10 for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.\nUnfortunately, that update introduced a regression around accessability\nsupport that prevented some Java applications from starting.\nThis update fixes the problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly validate types in some\n situations. An attacker could use this to construct a Java class that could\n possibly bypass sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2018-2825, CVE-2018-2826)\n\n It was discovered that the PatternSyntaxException class in OpenJDK did not\n properly validate arguments passed to it. An attacker could use this to\n potentially construct a class that caused a denial of service (excessive\n memory consumption). (CVE-2018-2952)\n\n Daniel Bleichenbacher discovered a vulnerability in the Galois/Counter Mode\n (GCM) mode of operation for symmetric block ciphers in OpenJDK. An attacker\n could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-2972)\n",
