  "details": "Piotr Krysiuk discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly enforce limits for pointer operations. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-33200)\n\nPiotr Krysiuk and Benedict Schlueter discovered that the eBPF\nimplementation in the Linux kernel performed out of bounds speculation on\npointer arithmetic. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2021-29155)\n\nPiotr Krysiuk discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly prevent speculative loads in certain situations. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2021-31829)\n\nReiji Watanabe discovered that the KVM VMX implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly prevent user space from tampering with an array\nindex value, leading to a potential out-of-bounds write. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3501)\n",
