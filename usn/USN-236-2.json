  "description": "USN-236-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in xpdf. kpdf and kword\ncontain copies of xpdf code and are thus vulnerable to the same\nissues.\n\nFor reference, this is the original advisory:\n\n  Chris Evans discovered several integer overflows in the XPDF code,\n  which is present in xpdf, the Poppler library, and tetex-bin. By\n  tricking an user into opening a specially crafted PDF file, an\n  attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the\n  privileges of the application that processes the document.",
