  "details": "Alexander Minozhenko and James Bunton discovered that Node.js did not\nproperly handle wildcards in name fields of X.509 TLS certificates. An\nattacker could use this vulnerability to execute a machine-in-the-middle-\nattack. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM and 16.04 ESM. (CVE-2016-7099)\n\nIt was discovered that Node.js incorrectly handled certain NAPTR responses.\nA remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause applications using\nNode.js to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected\nUbuntu 16.04 ESM. (CVE-2017-1000381)\n\nNikita Skovoroda discovered that Node.js mishandled certain input, leading\nto an out of bounds write. An attacker could use this vulnerability to\ncause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. This\nissue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 ESM. (CVE-2018-12115)\n\nArkadiy Tetelman discovered that Node.js improperly handled certain\nmalformed HTTP requests. An attacker could use this vulnerability to inject\nunexpected HTTP requests. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 ESM.\n(CVE-2018-12116)\n\nJan Maybach discovered that Node.js did not time out if incomplete\nHTTP/HTTPS headers were received. An attacker could use this vulnerability\nto cause a denial of service by keeping HTTP/HTTPS connections alive for a\nlong period of time. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 ESM.\n(CVE-2018-12122)\n\nMartin Bajanik discovered that the url.parse() method would return\nincorrect results if it received specially crafted input. An attacker could\nuse this vulnerability to spoof the hostname and bypass hostname-specific\nsecurity controls. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 ESM. (CVE-2018-12123)\n\nIt was discovered that Node.js is vulnerable to a DNS rebinding attack which\ncould be exploited to perform remote code execution. An attack is possible\nfrom malicious websites open in a web browser with network access to the system\nrunning the Node.js process. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 ESM.\n(CVE-2018-7160)\n\nIt was discovered that the Buffer.fill() and Buffer.alloc() methods\nimproperly handled certain inputs. An attacker could use this vulnerability\nto cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 ESM.\n(CVE-2018-7167)\n\nMarco Pracucci discovered that Node.js mishandled HTTP and HTTPS\nconnections. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of\nservice. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 ESM. (CVE-2019-5737)\n",
