  "description": "Tavis Ormandy discovered a potential weakness in the signature\nverification of gnupg. gpgv and gpg --verify returned a successful\nexit code even if the checked file did not have any signature at all.\nThe recommended way of checking the result is to evaluate the status\nmessages, but some third party applications might just check the exit\ncode for determining whether or not a signature is valid. These\napplications could be tricked into erroneously reporting a valid\nsignature.\n\nPlease note that this does not affect the Ubuntu package signature\nchecks.",
