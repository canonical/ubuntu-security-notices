  "details": "It was discovered that Vim was incorrectly processing Vim buffers.\nAn attacker could possibly use this issue to perform illegal memory\naccess and expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-0554)\n\nIt was discovered that Vim was not properly performing bounds checks\nfor column numbers when replacing tabs with spaces or spaces with\ntabs, which could cause a heap buffer overflow. An attacker could\npossibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2022-0572)\n\nIt was discovered that Vim was not properly performing validation of\ndata that contained special multi-byte characters, which could cause\nan out-of-bounds read. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\ncause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-0685)\n\nIt was discovered that Vim was incorrectly processing data used to\ndefine indentation in a file, which could cause a heap buffer\noverflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial\nof service. (CVE-2022-0714)\n\nIt was discovered that Vim was incorrectly processing certain regular\nexpression patterns and strings, which could cause an out-of-bounds\nread. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2022-0729)\n\nIt was discovered that Vim was not properly performing bounds checks\nwhen executing spell suggestion commands, which could cause a heap\nbuffer overflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a\ndenial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-0943)\n\nIt was discovered that Vim was incorrectly performing bounds checks\nwhen processing invalid commands with composing characters in Ex\nmode, which could cause a buffer overflow. An attacker could possibly\nuse this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2022-1616)\n\nIt was discovered that Vim was not properly processing latin1 data\nwhen issuing Ex commands, which could cause a heap buffer overflow.\nAn attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of\nservice or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1619)\n\nIt was discovered that Vim was not properly performing memory\nmanagement when dealing with invalid regular expression patterns in\nbuffers, which could cause a NULL pointer dereference. An attacker\ncould possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2022-1620)\n\nIt was discovered that Vim was not properly processing invalid bytes\nwhen performing spell check operations, which could cause a heap\nbuffer overflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a\ndenial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1621)\n",
