An authenticated attacker with a limited scope could possibly create EC2 credentials with escalated permissions. (CVE-2020-12689, CVE-2020-12691)  It was discovered that OpenStack Keystone incorrectly handled the list of roles provided with OAuth1 access tokens. An authenticated user could possibly end up with more role assignments than intended. (CVE-2020-12690)  It was discovered that OpenStack Keystone incorrectly handled EC2 signature TTL checks. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to reuse Authorization headers. (CVE-2020-12692)",
