  "summary": "linux-azure-fde, linux-gke, linux-gkeop, linux-raspi-5.4 vulnerabilities",
  "details": "Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly track memory\nallocations for anonymous VMA mappings in some situations, leading to\npotential data structure reuse. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2022-42703)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the memory address space\naccounting implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-41222)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the instruction emulator\nof the Linux kernel on Arm 64-bit systems. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-20422)\n\nIt was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle virtual CPUs without APICs in certain situations. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host system\ncrash). (CVE-2022-2153)\n\nHao Sun and Jiacheng Xu discovered that the NILFS file system\nimplementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2978)\n\nJohannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi discovered that for some Intel x86-64\nprocessors, the Linux kernel's protections against speculative branch\ntarget injection attacks were insufficient in some circumstances. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2022-29901)\n\nAbhishek Shah discovered a race condition in the PF_KEYv2 implementation in\nthe Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel\nmemory). (CVE-2022-3028)\n\nIt was discovered that the Netlink device interface implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a\nuse-after-free vulnerability with some network device drivers. A local\nattacker with admin access to the network device could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2022-3625)\n\nIt was discovered that the IDT 77252 ATM PCI device driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly remove any pending timers during device exit,\nresulting in a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could\npossibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3635)\n\nXingyuan Mo and Gengjia Chen discovered that the Promise SuperTrak EX\nstorage controller driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle\ncertain structures. A local attacker could potentially use this to expose\nsensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-40768)\n\nS\u00f6nke Huster discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the\nWiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-42719)\n",
