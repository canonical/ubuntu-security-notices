  "details": "USN-3797-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04\nLTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux\nHardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu\n14.04 LTS.\n\nNoam Rathaus discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the\nInfiniband implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-14734)\n\nIt was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the CD-ROM driver of\nthe Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation (kernel memory). (CVE-2018-16658)\n\nIt was discovered that a integer overflow existed in the HID Bluetooth\nimplementation in the Linux kernel that could lead to a buffer overwrite.\nAn attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-9363)\n\nYves Younan discovered that the CIPSO labeling implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle IP header options in some situations. A\nremote attacker could use this to specially craft network traffic that\ncould cause a denial of service (infinite loop). (CVE-2018-10938)\n",
