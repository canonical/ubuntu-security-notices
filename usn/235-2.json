  "description": "USN-235-1 fixed a vulnerability in sudo's handling of environment\nvariables. Tavis Ormandy noticed that sudo did not filter out the\nPYTHONINSPECT environment variable, so that users with the limited\nprivilege of calling a python script with sudo could still escalate\ntheir privileges.\n\nFor reference, this is the original advisory:\n\n  Charles Morris discovered a privilege escalation vulnerability in\n  sudo.  On executing Perl scripts with sudo, various environment\n  variables that affect Perl's library search path were not cleaned\n  properly. If sudo is set up to grant limited sudo execution of Perl\n  scripts to normal users, this could be exploited to run arbitrary\n  commands as the target user.\n\n  This security update also filters out environment variables that can\n  be exploited similarly with Python, Ruby, and zsh scripts.\n\n  Please note that this does not affect the default Ubuntu\n  installation,\n  or any setup that just grants full root privileges to certain users.",
