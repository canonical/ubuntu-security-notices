  "details": "\nIt was discovered that the framebuffer driver on the Linux kernel did not\nverify size limits when changing font or screen size, leading to an out-of-\nbounds write. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-33655)\n\nSelim Enes Karaduman discovered that a race condition existed in the\nGeneral notification queue implementation of the Linux kernel, leading to a\nuse-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2022-1882)\n\nDuoming Zhou discovered that race conditions existed in the timer handling\nimplementation of the Linux kernel's Rose X.25 protocol layer, resulting in\nuse-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-2318)\n\nRoger Pau Monn\u00e9 discovered that the Xen virtual block driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly initialize memory pages to be used for shared\ncommunication with the backend. A local attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information (guest kernel memory). (CVE-2022-26365)\n\nPawan Kumar Gupta, Alyssa Milburn, Amit Peled, Shani Rehana, Nir Shildan\nand Ariel Sabba discovered that some Intel processors with Enhanced\nIndirect Branch Restricted Speculation (eIBRS) did not properly handle RET\ninstructions after a VM exits. A local attacker could potentially use this\nto expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-26373)\n\nEric Biggers discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the\nio_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3176)\n\nRoger Pau Monn\u00e9 discovered that the Xen paravirtualization frontend in the\nLinux kernel did not properly initialize memory pages to be used for shared\ncommunication with the backend. A local attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information (guest kernel memory). (CVE-2022-33740)\n\nIt was discovered that the Xen paravirtualization frontend in the Linux\nkernel incorrectly shared unrelated data when communicating with certain\nbackends. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(guest crash) or expose sensitive information (guest kernel memory).\n(CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742)\n\nJan Beulich discovered that the Xen network device frontend driver in the\nLinux kernel incorrectly handled socket buffers (skb) references when\ncommunicating with certain backends. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (guest crash). (CVE-2022-33743)\n\nOleksandr Tyshchenko discovered that the Xen paravirtualization platform in\nthe Linux kernel on ARM platforms contained a race condition in certain\nsituations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of\nservice in the host OS. (CVE-2022-33744)\n\nIt was discovered that the virtio RPMSG bus driver in the Linux kernel\ncontained a double-free vulnerability in certain error conditions. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2022-34494, CVE-2022-34495)\n\nIt was discovered that the Netlink Transformation (XFRM) subsystem in the\nLinux kernel contained a reference counting error. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-36879)\n\nDomingo Dirutigliano and Nicola Guerrera discovered that the netfilter\nsubsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle rules that truncated\npackets below the packet header size. When such rules are in place, a\nremote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2022-36946)\n\nJann Horn discovered that the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle TLB flush operations in some situations. A local attacker\nin a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (guest crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code in the guest kernel. (CVE-2022-39189)\n\n",
