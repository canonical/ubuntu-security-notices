                "description": "USN-4211-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.  Zhipeng Xie discovered that an infinite loop could be triggered in the CFS Linux kernel process scheduler. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-20784)  Nicolas Waisman discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel did not properly validate SSID lengths. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-17133)  Nicolas Waisman discovered that the Chelsio T4/T5 RDMA Driver for the Linux kernel performed DMA from a kernel stack. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-17075)",
