This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux\nHardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu\n14.04 LTS.\n\nIt was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU\ncore may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU\ncore. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local\nattacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation (memory from other guests or the host OS).
