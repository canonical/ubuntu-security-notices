  "details": "It was discovered that the netlink implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly validate policies when parsing attributes in some situations.\nAn attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (infinite\nrecursion). (CVE-2020-36691)\n\nBilly Jheng Bing Jhong discovered that the CIFS network file system\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate arguments to\nioctl() in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-0168)\n\nIt was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this\nto construct a malicious ext4 file system image that, when mounted, could\ncause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-1184)\n\nIt was discovered that some AMD x86-64 processors with SMT enabled could\nspeculatively execute instructions using a return address from a sibling\nthread. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2022-27672)\n\nWilliam Zhao discovered that the Traffic Control (TC) subsystem in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle network packet retransmission in\ncertain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (kernel deadlock). (CVE-2022-4269)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the qdisc implementation\nin the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-0590)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the btrfs file system\nimplementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-1611)\n\nIt was discovered that the APM X-Gene SoC hardware monitoring driver in the\nLinux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2023-1855)\n\nIt was discovered that the ST NCI NFC driver did not properly handle device\nremoval events. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1990)\n\nIt was discovered that the XFS file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly perform metadata validation when mounting certain\nimages. An attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image\nthat, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-2124)\n\nIt was discovered that the SLIMpro I2C device driver in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate user-supplied data in some situations, leading to\nan out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2023-2194)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the TLS subsystem in the\nLinux kernel, leading to a use-after-free or a null pointer dereference\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-28466)\n\nIt was discovered that the DA9150 charger driver in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle device removal, leading to a user-after free\nvulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-30772)\n\nIt was discovered that the btrfs file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle error conditions in some situations, leading\nto a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-3111)\n\nIt was discovered that the Ricoh R5C592 MemoryStick card reader driver in\nthe Linux kernel contained a race condition during module unload, leading\nto a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause\na denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-3141)\n\nIt was discovered that the Qualcomm EMAC ethernet driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle device removal, leading to a user-after free\nvulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-33203)\n\n",
