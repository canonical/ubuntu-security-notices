This update addresses the problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Felix Wilhelm, Fermin J. Serna, Gabriel Campana and Kevin Hamacher\n discovered that Dnsmasq incorrectly handled DNS requests. A remote attacker\n could use this issue to cause Dnsmasq to crash, resulting in a denial of\n service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-14491)\n \n Felix Wilhelm, Fermin J. Serna, Gabriel Campana and Kevin Hamacher\n discovered that Dnsmasq incorrectly handled IPv6 router advertisements. A\n remote attacker could use this issue to cause Dnsmasq to crash, resulting\n in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n (CVE-2017-14492)\n \n Felix Wilhelm, Fermin J. Serna, Gabriel Campana and Kevin Hamacher\n discovered that Dnsmasq incorrectly handled DHCPv6 requests. A remote\n attacker could use this issue to cause Dnsmasq to crash, resulting in a\n denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-14493)\n \n Felix Wilhelm, Fermin J.

A remote\n attacker could use this issue to possibly obtain sensitive memory contents.\n (CVE-2017-14494)\n \n Felix Wilhelm, Fermin J. Serna, Gabriel Campana and Kevin Hamacher\n discovered that Dnsmasq incorrectly handled DNS requests. A remote attacker\n could use this issue to cause Dnsmasq to consume memory, resulting in a\n denial of service. (CVE-2017-14495)\n \n Felix Wilhelm, Fermin J. Serna, Gabriel Campana and Kevin Hamacher\n discovered that Dnsmasq incorrectly handled DNS requests. A remote attacker\n could use this issue to cause Dnsmasq to crash, resulting in a denial of\n service. (CVE-2017-14496)\n",
