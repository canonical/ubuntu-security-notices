  "details": "Several memory corruption bugs were discovered in ICU. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash\nor execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render\nprocess. (CVE-2014-7923, CVE-2014-7926)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in the IndexedDB implementation. If a user\nwere tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application\ncrash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking\nthe program. (CVE-2014-7924)\n\nA use-after free was discovered in the WebAudio implementation in Blink.\nIf a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an\nattacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via\nrenderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nsandboxed render process. (CVE-2014-7925)\n\nSeveral memory corruption bugs were discovered in V8. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash\nor execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render\nprocess. (CVE-2014-7927, CVE-2014-7928, CVE-2014-7931)\n\nSeveral use-after free bugs were discovered in the DOM implementation in\nBlink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,\nan attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service\nvia renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nsandboxed render process. (CVE-2014-7929, CVE-2014-7930, CVE-2014-7932,\nCVE-2014-7934)\n\nA use-after free was discovered in FFmpeg. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2014-7933)\n\nMultiple off-by-one errors were discovered in FFmpeg. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash\nor execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render\nprocess. (CVE-2014-7937)\n\nA memory corruption bug was discovered in the fonts implementation. If a\nuser were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker\ncould potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer\ncrash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed\nrender process. (CVE-2014-7938)\n\nIt was discovered that ICU did not initialize memory for a data structure\ncorrectly. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\nwebsite, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of\nservice via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges\nof the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2014-7940)\n\nIt was discovered that the fonts implementation did not initialize memory\nfor a data structure correctly. If a user were tricked in to opening a\nspecially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\ncause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code\nwith the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2014-7942)\n\nAn out-of-bounds read was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. (CVE-2014-7943)\n\nAn out-of-bounds read was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. (CVE-2014-7946)\n\nIt was discovered that the AppCache proceeded with caching for SSL\nsessions even if there is a certificate error. A remote attacker could\npotentially exploit this by conducting a MITM attack to modify HTML\napplication content. (CVE-2014-7948)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial\nof service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1205)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked\nin to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\nexploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via\nrenderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nsandboxed render process.
