  "details": "Ke Sun, Alyssa Milburn, Henrique Kawakami, Emma Benoit, Igor Chervatyuk,\nLisa Aichele, and Thais Moreira Hamasaki discovered that the Spectre\nVariant 2 mitigations for AMD processors on Linux were insufficient in some\nsituations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2021-26401)\n\nIt was discovered that the MMC/SD subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle read errors from SD cards in certain situations. An\nattacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel\nmemory). (CVE-2022-20008)\n\nIt was discovered that the USB gadget subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly validate interface descriptor requests. An attacker could possibly\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-25258)\n\nIt was discovered that the Remote NDIS (RNDIS) USB gadget implementation in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly validate the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET\ncommand. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive\ninformation (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-25375)\n\nIt was discovered that the ST21NFCA NFC driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly validate the size of certain data in EVT_TRANSACTION events. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-26490)\n\nIt was discovered that the USB SR9700 ethernet device driver for the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate the length of requests from the device. A\nphysically proximate attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive\ninformation (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-26966)\n\nIt was discovered that the Xilinx USB2 device gadget driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate endpoint indices from the host. A\nphysically proximate attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2022-27223)\n\nMiaoqian Lin discovered that the RDMA Transport (RTRS) client\nimplementation in the Linux kernel contained a double-free when handling\ncertain error conditions. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2022-29156)\n",
