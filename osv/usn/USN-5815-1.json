  "details": "It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Android Binder IPC\nsubsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-20421)\n\nDavid Leadbeater discovered that the netfilter IRC protocol tracking\nimplementation in the Linux Kernel incorrectly handled certain message\npayloads in some situations. A remote attacker could possibly use this to\ncause a denial of service or bypass firewall filtering. (CVE-2022-2663)\n\nIt was discovered that the Intel 740 frame buffer driver in the Linux\nkernel contained a divide by zero vulnerability. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3061)\n\nIt was discovered that the sound subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a\nrace condition in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause\na denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3303)\n\nGwnaun Jung discovered that the SFB packet scheduling implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3586)\n\nIt was discovered that the NILFS2 file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. An\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2022-3646)\n\nHyunwoo Kim discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in\nthe PXA3xx graphics driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could\npossibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2022-39842)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the EFI capsule loader\ndriver in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-40307)\n\nZheng Wang and Zhuorao Yang discovered that the RealTek RTL8712U wireless\ndriver in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-4095)\n\nIt was discovered that the USB monitoring (usbmon) component in the Linux\nkernel did not properly set permissions on memory mapped in to user space\nprocesses. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-43750)\n\nJann Horn discovered a race condition existed in the Linux kernel when\nunmapping VMAs in certain situations, resulting in possible use-after-free\nvulnerabilities. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-39188)\n",
