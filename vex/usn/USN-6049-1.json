                "description": "It was discovered that Netty's Zlib decoders did not limit memory allocations. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Netty to exhaust memory via malicious input, leading to a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 ESM and Ubuntu 20.04 ESM. (CVE-2020-11612)  It was discovered that Netty created temporary files with excessive permissions. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to expose sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 ESM, Ubuntu 18.04 ESM, and Ubuntu 20.04 ESM. (CVE-2021-21290)  It was discovered that Netty did not properly validate content-length headers. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to smuggle requests. This issue was only fixed in Ubuntu 20.04 ESM. (CVE-2021-21295, CVE-2021-21409)  It was discovered that Netty's Bzip2 decompression decoder did not limit the decompressed output data size. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Netty to exhaust memory via malicious input, leading to a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 ESM, Ubuntu 20.04 ESM, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2021-37136)  It was discovered that Netty's Snappy frame decoder function did not limit chunk lengths. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Netty to exhaust memory via malicious input, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2021-37137)  It was discovered that Netty did not properly handle control chars at the beginning and end of header names. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to smuggle requests. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 ESM, Ubuntu 20.04 ESM, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2021-43797)  It was discovered that Netty could be made into an infinite recursion when parsing a malformed crafted message. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Netty to crash, leading to a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 ESM, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2022-41881)  It was discovered that Netty did not validate header values under certain circumstances. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform HTTP response splitting via malicious header values. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 ESM, Ubuntu 20.04 ESM, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2022-41915)",
