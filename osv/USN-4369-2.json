  "details": "USN-4369-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the 5.3 Linux kernel. Unfortunately,\nthat update introduced a regression in overlayfs. This update corrects\nthe problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that the btrfs implementation in the Linux kernel did not\n properly detect that a block was marked dirty in some situations. An\n attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when\n unmounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-19377)\n\n Tristan Madani discovered that the file locking implementation in the Linux\n kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could possibly use this\n to cause a denial of service or expose sensitive information.\n (CVE-2019-19769)\n\n It was discovered that the Serial CAN interface driver in the Linux kernel\n did not properly initialize data. A local attacker could use this to expose\n sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-11494)\n\n It was discovered that the linux kernel did not properly validate certain\n mount options to the tmpfs virtual memory file system. A local attacker\n with the ability to specify mount options could use this to cause a denial\n of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-11565)\n\n It was discovered that the OV51x USB Camera device driver in the Linux\n kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate\n attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n (CVE-2020-11608)\n\n It was discovered that the STV06XX USB Camera device driver in the Linux\n kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate\n attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n (CVE-2020-11609)\n\n It was discovered that the Xirlink C-It USB Camera device driver in the\n Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically\n proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\n crash). (CVE-2020-11668)\n\n It was discovered that the block layer in the Linux kernel contained a race\n condition leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could\n possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute\n arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-12657)\n",
