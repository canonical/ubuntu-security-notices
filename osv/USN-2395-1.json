  "details": "\nNadav Amit reported that the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) mishandles\nnoncanonical addresses when emulating instructions that change the rip\n(Instruction Pointer). A guest user with access to I/O or the MMIO can use\nthis flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) of the guest.\n(CVE-2014-3647)\n\nA flaw was discovered with the handling of the invept instruction in the\nKVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux kernel. An unprivileged\nguest user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) on the guest. (CVE-2014-3646)\n\nLars Bull reported a race condition in the PIT (programmable interrupt\ntimer) emulation in the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux\nkernel. A local guest user with access to PIT i/o ports could exploit this\nflaw to cause a denial of service (crash) on the host. (CVE-2014-3611)\n\nLars Bull and Nadav Amit reported a flaw in how KVM (the Kernel Virtual\nMachine) handles noncanonical writes to certain MSR registers. A privileged\nguest user can exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel\npanic) on the host. (CVE-2014-3610)\n\nA bounds check error was discovered in the driver for the Logitech Unifying\nreceivers and devices. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this\nflaw to to cause a denial of service (invalid kfree) or to execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2014-3182)\n\nRaphael Geissert reported a NULL pointer dereference in the Linux kernel's\nCIFS client. A remote CIFS server could cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or possibly have other unspecified impact by deleting IPC$ share\nduring resolution of DFS referrals. (CVE-2014-7145)\n",
