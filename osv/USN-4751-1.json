  "details": "It was discovered that the console keyboard driver in the Linux kernel\ncontained a race condition. A local attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-25656)\n\nMinh Yuan discovered that the tty driver in the Linux kernel contained race\nconditions when handling fonts. A local attacker could possibly use this to\nexpose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-25668)\n\nBodong Zhao discovered a use-after-free in the Sun keyboard driver\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2020-25669)\n\nKiyin (\u5c39\u4eae) discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly deallocate memory in some situations. A privileged attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2020-25704)\n\nJulien Grall discovered that the Xen dom0 event handler in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly limit the number of events queued. An attacker in a guest\nVM could use this to cause a denial of service in the host OS.\n(CVE-2020-27673)\n\nJinoh Kang discovered that the Xen event channel infrastructure in the\nLinux kernel contained a race condition. An attacker in guest could\npossibly use this to cause a denial of service (dom0 crash).\n(CVE-2020-27675)\n\nDaniel Axtens discovered that PowerPC RTAS implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly restrict memory accesses in some situations. A\nprivileged local attacker could use this to arbitrarily modify kernel\nmemory, potentially bypassing kernel lockdown restrictions.\n(CVE-2020-27777)\n\nIt was discovered that the jfs file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel contained an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker\ncould use this to possibly cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2020-27815)\n\nShisong Qin and Bodong Zhao discovered that Speakup screen reader driver in\nthe Linux kernel did not correctly handle setting line discipline in some\nsituations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2020-27830, CVE-2020-28941)\n\nIt was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the\ninfiniband hfi1 device driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could\npossibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2020-27835)\n\nIt was discovered that an information leak existed in the syscall\nimplementation in the Linux kernel on 32 bit systems. A local attacker\ncould use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2020-28588)\n\nMinh Yuan discovered that the framebuffer console driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle fonts in some conditions. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexpose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-28974)\n\nMichael Kurth and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz discovered that the Xen event\nprocessing backend in the Linux kernel did not properly limit the number of\nevents queued. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial\nof service in the host OS. (CVE-2020-29568)\n\nOlivier Benjamin and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz discovered a race condition the\nXen paravirt block backend in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial\nof service in the host OS. (CVE-2020-29569)\n\nJann Horn discovered that the tty subsystem of the Linux kernel did not use\nconsistent locking in some situations, leading to a read-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2020-29660)\n\nJann Horn discovered a race condition in the tty subsystem of the Linux\nkernel in the locking for the TIOCSPGRP ioctl(), leading to a use-after-\nfree vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-29661)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed that caused the Linux\nkernel to not properly restrict exit signal delivery. A local attacker\ncould possibly use this to send signals to arbitrary processes.\n(CVE-2020-35508)\n",
