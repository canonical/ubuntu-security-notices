  "details": "Bob Clary, Christian Holler, Nils Ohlmeier, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman,\nCarsten Book, Randell Jesup, Nicolas Pierron, Eric Rescorla, Tyson Smith,\nand Gabor Krizsanits discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox.\nIf a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an\nattacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via\napplication crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nuser invoking Firefox. (CVE-2016-1930, CVE-2016-1931)\n\nGustavo Grieco discovered an out-of-memory crash when loading GIF images\nin some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially\ncrafted website, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2016-1933)\n\nAki Helin discovered a buffer overflow when rendering WebGL content in\nsome circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially\ncrafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a\ndenial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with\nthe privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2016-1935)\n\nIt was discovered that a delay was missing when focusing the protocol\nhandler dialog. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\nwebsite, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct\nclickjacking attacks. (CVE-2016-1937)\n\nHanno B\u00f6ck discovered that calculations with mp_div and mp_exptmod in NSS\nproduce incorrect results in some circumstances, resulting in\ncryptographic weaknesses. (CVE-2016-1938)\n\nNicholas Hurley discovered that Firefox allows for control characters to\nbe set in cookie names. An attacker could potentially exploit this to\nconduct cookie injection attacks on some web servers. (CVE-2016-1939)\n\nIt was discovered that when certain invalid URLs are pasted in to the\naddressbar, the addressbar contents may be manipulated to show the\nlocation of arbitrary websites. An attacker could potentially exploit this\nto conduct URL spoofing attacks. (CVE-2016-1942)\n\nRonald Crane discovered three vulnerabilities through code inspection. If\na user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker\ncould potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via\napplication crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nuser invoking Firefox. (CVE-2016-1944, CVE-2016-1945, CVE-2016-1946)\n\nFran\u00e7ois Marier discovered that Application Reputation lookups didn't\nwork correctly, disabling warnings for potentially malicious downloads. An\nattacker could potentially exploit this by tricking a user in to\ndownloading a malicious file. Other parts of the Safe Browsing feature\nwere unaffected by this. (CVE-2016-1947)\n",
