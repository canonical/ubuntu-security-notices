A local attacker could use this to gain\nelevated privileges. (CVE-2021-3493)\n\nVincent Dehors discovered that the shiftfs file system in the Ubuntu Linux\nkernel did not properly handle faults in copy_from_user() when passing\nthrough ioctls to an underlying file system. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion) or execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2021-3492)\n",
