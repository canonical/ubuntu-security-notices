  "description": "USN-274-1 fixed a logging bypass in the MySQL server. Unfortunately it\nwas determined that the original update was not sufficient to\ncompletely fix the vulnerability, thus another update is necessary. We\napologize for the inconvenience.\n\nFor reference, these are the details of the original USN:\n\n  A logging bypass was discovered in the MySQL query parser. A local\n  attacker could exploit this by inserting NUL characters into query\n  strings (even into comments), which would cause the query to be\n  logged incompletely.\n\n  This only affects you if you enabled the 'log' parameter in the\n  MySQL configuration.",
