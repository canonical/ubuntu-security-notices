  "details": "Hunter Wittenborn discovered that Go incorrectly handled the sanitization\nof environment variables. An attacker could possibly use this issue to run\narbitrary commands. (CVE-2023-24531)\n\nSohom Datta discovered that Go did not properly validate backticks (`) as\nJavascript string delimiters, and did not escape them as expected. An\nattacker could possibly use this issue to inject arbitrary Javascript code\ninto the Go template. (CVE-2023-24538)\n\nJuho Nurminen discovered that Go incorrectly handled certain special\ncharacters in directory or file paths. An attacker could possibly use\nthis issue to inject code into the resulting binaries. (CVE-2023-29402)\n\nVincent Dehors discovered that Go incorrectly handled permission bits.\nAn attacker could possibly use this issue to read or write files with\nelevated privileges. (CVE-2023-29403)\n\nJuho Nurminen discovered that Go incorrectly handled certain crafted\narguments. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary\ncode at build time. (CVE-2023-29405)\n\nIt was discovered that Go incorrectly validated the contents of host\nheaders. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to inject\nadditional headers or entire requests. (CVE-2023-29406)\n\nTakeshi Kaneko discovered that Go did not properly handle comments and\nspecial tags in the script context of html/template module. An attacker\ncould possibly use this issue to inject Javascript code and perform a\ncross-site scripting attack.

An attacker could\npossibly use this issue to cause a panic resulting in a denial of service.\n(CVE-2023-39325)\n\nIt was discovered that the Go html/template module did not validate errors\nreturned from MarshalJSON methods. An attacker could possibly use this\nissue to inject arbitrary code into the Go template. (CVE-2024-24785)\n",
