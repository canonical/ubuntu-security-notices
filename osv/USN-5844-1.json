  "details": "David Benjamin discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled X.400 address\nprocessing. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to read\narbitrary memory contents or cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial\nof service. (CVE-2023-0286)\n\nCorey Bonnell discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled X.509 certificate\nverification. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause\nOpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only\naffected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2022-4203)\n\nHubert Kario discovered that OpenSSL had a timing based side channel in the\nOpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation. A remote attacker could possibly use\nthis issue to recover sensitive information. (CVE-2022-4304)\n\nDawei Wang discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled parsing certain PEM\ndata. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2022-4450)\n\nOctavio Galland and Marcel B\u00f6hme discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly\nhandled streaming ASN.1 data. A remote attacker could use this issue to\ncause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-0215)\n\nMarc Sch\u00f6nefeld discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled malformed PKCS7\ndata. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu\n22.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2023-0216)\n\nKurt Roeckx discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled validating certain\nDSA public keys. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause\nOpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only\naffected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2023-0217)\n\nHubert Kario and Dmitry Belyavsky discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly\nvalidated certain signatures. A remote attacker could possibly use this\nissue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This\nissue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2023-0401)\n",
