  "details": "An unspecified security issue was discovered in Blink. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions.\n(CVE-2016-1673)\n\nAn issue was discovered with Document reattachment in Blink in some\ncircumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\nwebsite, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin\nrestrictions. (CVE-2016-1675)\n\nA type confusion bug was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2016-1677)\n\nA heap overflow was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening\na specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\ncause a denial of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2016-1678)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in the V8ValueConverter implementation in\nChromium in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a\nspecially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\ncause a denial of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2016-1679)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2016-1680)\n\nA security issue was discovered in ServiceWorker registration in Blink in\nsome circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially\ncrafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass\nContent Security Policy (CSP) protections. (CVE-2016-1682)\n\nAn out-of-bounds memory access was discovered in libxslt. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to cause a denial of service (application crash)\nor execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-1683)\n\nAn integer overflow was discovered in libxslt. If a user were tricked in\nto opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\nexploit this to cause a denial of service (application crash or resource\nconsumption). (CVE-2016-1684)\n\nAn out-of-bounds read was discovered in the regular expression\nimplementation in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially\ncrafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a\ndenial of service (application crash). (CVE-2016-1688)\n\nA heap overflow was discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2016-1689)\n\nA heap overflow was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2016-1691)\n\nIt was discovered that Blink permits cross-origin loading of stylesheets\nby a service worker even when the stylesheet download has an incorrect\nMIME type. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\nwebsite, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin\nrestrictions. (CVE-2016-1692)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial\nof service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-1695,\nCVE-2016-1703)\n\nIt was discovered that Blink does not prevent frame navigation during\nDocumentLoader detach operations. If a user were tricked in to opening a\nspecially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\nbypass same-origin restrictions. (CVE-2016-1697)\n\nA parameter sanitization bug was discovered in the devtools subsystem in\nBlink. An attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass intended\naccess restrictions. (CVE-2016-1699)\n\nAn out-of-bounds read was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in\nto opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\nexploit this to cause a denial of service (application crash).\n(CVE-2016-1702)\n",
