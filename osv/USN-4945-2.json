  "summary": "linux-raspi, linux-raspi-5.4 vulnerabilities",
  "details": "\nUSN-4945-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu\n20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding\nLinux kernel updates targeted specifically for Raspberry Pi devices\nin those same Ubuntu Releases.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\nIt was discovered that the Nouveau GPU driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle error conditions in some situations. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-25639)\n\nJan Beulich discovered that the Xen netback backend in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle certain error conditions under paravirtualization. An\nattacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service\n(host domain crash). (CVE-2021-28038)\n\nIt was discovered that the fastrpc driver in the Linux kernel did not\nprevent user space applications from sending kernel RPC messages. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges.\n(CVE-2021-28375)\n\nIt was discovered that the Realtek RTL8188EU Wireless device driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate ssid lengths in some situations. An\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2021-28660)\n\nIt was discovered that the USB/IP driver in the Linux kernel contained race\nconditions during the update of local and shared status. An attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-29265)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the netfilter subsystem\nof the Linux kernel when replacing tables. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-29650)\n\nArnd Bergmann discovered that the video4linux subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2021-30002)\n",
