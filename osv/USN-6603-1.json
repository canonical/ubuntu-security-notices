  "details": "It was discovered that the CIFS network file system implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate the server frame size in certain\nsituation, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. An attacker\ncould use this to construct a malicious CIFS image that, when operated on,\ncould cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2023-6606)\n\nBudimir Markovic, Lucas De Marchi, and Pengfei Xu discovered that the perf\nsubsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate all event sizes\nwhen attaching new events, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability.\nA local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-6931)\n\nIt was discovered that the IGMP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel\ncontained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-6932)\n\n",
