Carroll discovered that the NVIDIA Cuda grpahics driver did not\n properly perform access control when performing IPC. An attacker could use\n this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n (CVE-2020-5963)\n\n It was discovered that the UVM driver in the NVIDIA graphics driver\n contained a race condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a\n denial of service. (CVE-2020-5967)\n\n It was discovered that the NVIDIA virtual GPU guest drivers contained\n an unspecified vulnerability that could potentially lead to privileged\n operation execution. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of\n service. (CVE-2020-5973)\n",
