  "details": "Praveen Kariyanahalli, Ivan Fratric and Felix Groebert discovered that\nOpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when buffering DTLS data. A remote\nattacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a\ndenial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-8176)\n\nJoseph Barr-Pixton discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled malformed\nECParameters structures. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause\nOpenSSL to hang, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-1788)\n\nRobert Swiecki and Hanno B\u00f6ck discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled\ncertain ASN1_TIME strings. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause\nOpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-1789)\n\nMichal Zalewski discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled missing content\nwhen parsing ASN.1-encoded PKCS#7 blobs. A remote attacker could use this\nissue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n(CVE-2015-1790)\n\nEmilia K\u00e4sper discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled NewSessionTicket\nwhen being used by a multi-threaded client. A remote attacker could use\nthis issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n(CVE-2015-1791)\n\nJohannes Bauer discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled verifying\nsignedData messages using the CMS code. A remote attacker could use this\nissue to cause OpenSSL to hang, resulting in a denial of service.\n(CVE-2015-1792)\n\nAs a security improvement, this update also modifies OpenSSL behaviour to\nreject DH key sizes below 768 bits, preventing a possible downgrade\nattack.\n",
