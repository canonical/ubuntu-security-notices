  "description": "Tomas Mraz discovered a shell code injection flaw in scp. When doing\nlocal-to-local or remote-to-remote copying, scp expanded shell escape\ncharacters. By tricking an user into using scp on a specially crafted\nfile name (which could also be caught by using an innocuous wild card\nlike '*'), an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary shell\ncommands with the privilege of that user.\n\nPlease be aware that scp is not designed to operate securely on\nuntrusted file names, since it needs to stay compatible with rcp.\nPlease use sftp for automated systems and potentially untrusted file\nnames.",
