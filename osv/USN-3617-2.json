  "details": "USN-3617-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 17.10.\nThis update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware\nEnablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 17.10 for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability existed in the ALSA PCM subsystem of the Linux kernel. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-0861)\n\nIt was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel allowed\npassthrough of the diagnostic I/O port 0x80. An attacker in a guest VM\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS.\n(CVE-2017-1000407)\n\nIt was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the\nnetwork namespaces implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-15129)\n\nAndrey Konovalov discovered that the usbtest device driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate endpoint metadata. A physically proximate\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2017-16532)\n\nAndrey Konovalov discovered that the SoundGraph iMON USB driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically\nproximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2017-16537)\n\nAndrey Konovalov discovered that the IMS Passenger Control Unit USB driver\nin the Linux kernel did not properly validate device descriptors. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2017-16645)\n\nAndrey Konovalov discovered that the DiBcom DiB0700 USB DVB driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle detach events. A physically proximate\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2017-16646)\n\nAndrey Konovalov discovered that the ASIX Ethernet USB driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle suspend and resume events. A physically\nproximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2017-16647)\n\nAndrey Konovalov discovered that the CDC USB Ethernet driver did not\nproperly validate device descriptors. A physically proximate attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-16649)\n\nAndrey Konovalov discovered that the QMI WWAN USB driver did not properly\nvalidate device descriptors. A physically proximate attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-16650)\n\nIt was discovered that the HugeTLB component of the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle holes in hugetlb ranges. A local attacker could use this to\nexpose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2017-16994)\n\nIt was discovered that the netfilter component of the Linux did not\nproperly restrict access to the connection tracking helpers list. A local\nattacker could use this to bypass intended access restrictions.\n(CVE-2017-17448)\n\nIt was discovered that the netfilter passive OS fingerprinting (xt_osf)\nmodule did not properly perform access control checks. A local attacker\ncould improperly modify the system-wide OS fingerprint list.\n(CVE-2017-17450)\n\nDmitry Vyukov discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel\ncontained an out-of-bounds read when handling memory-mapped I/O. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-17741)\n\nIt was discovered that the Salsa20 encryption algorithm implementations in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly handle zero-length inputs. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2017-17805)\n\nIt was discovered that the HMAC implementation did not validate the state\nof the underlying cryptographic hash algorithm. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2017-17806)\n\nIt was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly check permissions when a key request was performed on a task's\ndefault keyring. A local attacker could use this to add keys to\nunauthorized keyrings. (CVE-2017-17807)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the OCFS2 file system\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). (CVE-2017-18204)\n\nIt was discovered that the Broadcom NetXtremeII ethernet driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate Generic Segment Offload (GSO) packet\nsizes. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (interface\nunavailability). (CVE-2018-1000026)\n\nIt was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Socket (RDS) implementation in\nthe Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write during RDMA page allocation. An\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-5332)\n\nMohamed Ghannam discovered a null pointer dereference in the RDS (Reliable\nDatagram Sockets) protocol implementation of the Linux kernel. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2018-5333)\n\n\u8303\u9f99\u98de discovered that a race condition existed in loop block device\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2018-5344)\n",
