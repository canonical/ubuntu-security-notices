  "summary": "linux, linux-aws, linux-kvm, linux-raspi2, linux-snapdragon vulnerabilities",
  "details": "Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel could possibly perform an out of bounds write when updating the\njournal for an inline file. An attacker could use this to construct a\nmalicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2018-10883)\n\nVasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov discovered that the cleancache subsystem\nof the Linux kernel did not properly initialize new files in some\nsituations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2018-16862)\n\nWei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-19407)\n\nMathias Payer and Hui Peng discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the\nAdvanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem. A physically proximate\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2018-19824)\n\nHui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB subsystem in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle size checks when handling an extra USB\ndescriptor. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-20169)\n",
