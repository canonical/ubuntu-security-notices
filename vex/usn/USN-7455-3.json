        "description": "Jann Horn discovered that the watch_queue event notification subsystem in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2022-0995)  Several security issues were discovered in the Linux kernel. An attacker could possibly use these to compromise the system. This update corrects flaws in the following subsystems:   - Network drivers;   - File systems infrastructure;   - NTFS3 file system;   - Ethernet bridge;   - Ethtool driver;   - IPv6 networking;   - Network traffic control;   - VMware vSockets driver; (CVE-2024-56651, CVE-2025-21756, CVE-2024-26837, CVE-2025-21700, CVE-2024-46826, CVE-2024-50256, CVE-2024-50248, CVE-2025-21993, CVE-2025-21702, CVE-2025-21701, CVE-2025-21703)",
