  "summary": "linux, linux-aws, linux-kvm, linux-lts-xenial, linux-raspi2, linux-snapdragon vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the jfs file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel contained an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker\ncould use this to possibly cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2020-27815)\n\nIt was discovered that the memory management subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly handle copy-on-write operations in some situations. A\nlocal attacker could possibly use this to gain unintended write access to\nread-only memory pages. (CVE-2020-29374)\n\nMichael Kurth and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz discovered that the Xen event\nprocessing backend in the Linux kernel did not properly limit the number of\nevents queued. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial\nof service in the host OS. (CVE-2020-29568)\n\nJann Horn discovered that the tty subsystem of the Linux kernel did not use\nconsistent locking in some situations, leading to a read-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2020-29660)\n\nJann Horn discovered a race condition in the tty subsystem of the Linux\nkernel in the locking for the TIOCSPGRP ioctl(), leading to a use-after-\nfree vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-29661)\n",
