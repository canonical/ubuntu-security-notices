  "summary": "linux-oem-5.10 vulnerabilities",
  "details": "Valentina Palmiotti discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux\nkernel could be coerced to free adjacent memory. A local attacker could use\nthis to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-41073)\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly enforce certain\ntypes of entries in the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (aka dbx)\nprotection mechanism. An attacker could use this to bypass UEFI Secure Boot\nrestrictions. (CVE-2020-26541)\n\nIt was discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations,\nleading to a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker who could start and\ncontrol a VM could possibly use this to expose sensitive information or\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-22543)\n\nMurray McAllister discovered that the joystick device interface in the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate data passed via an ioctl(). A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code on systems with a joystick device\nregistered. (CVE-2021-3612)\n\nIt was discovered that the Virtio console implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate input lengths in some situations. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2021-38160)\n\nMichael Wakabayashi discovered that the NFSv4 client implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly order connection setup operations. An\nattacker controlling a remote NFS server could use this to cause a denial\nof service on the client. (CVE-2021-38199)\n\n",
