  "description": "Marco Alvarez found a Denial of Service vulnerability in the Jabber\nprotocol handler. A remote attacker could exploit this to crash Gaim\nby sending specially crafted file transfers to the user.\n(CAN-2005-0967)\n\nStu Tomlinson discovered an insufficient bounds checking flaw in the\nURL parser. By sending a message containing a very long URL, a remote\nattacker could crash Gaim or execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user. This was not possible on all protocols, due to\nmessage length restrictions. Jabber are SILC were known to be\nvulnerable. (CAN-2005-1261)\n\nSiebe Tolsma discovered a Denial of Service attack in the MSN handler.\nBy sending a specially crafted SLP message with an empty body, a\nremote attacker could crash Gaim. (CAN-2005-1262)",
