                "description": "It was discovered that the Traffic-Control Index (TCINDEX) implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-1281)  It was discovered that the Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly enforce policy in certain conditions. A privileged attacker could use this to bypass Kernel lockdown restrictions. (CVE-2022-21505)  It was discovered that the infrared transceiver USB driver did not properly handle USB control messages. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2022-3903)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the SMSC UFX USB driver implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-41849)  Gerald Lee discovered that the USB Gadget file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-4382)  It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the SCTP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2023-1074)  Mingi Cho discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize a data structure, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1095)  It was discovered that the RNDIS USB driver in the Linux kernel contained an integer overflow vulnerability. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a malicious USB device to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-23559)  It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate attributes in certain situations, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-26607)  Duoming Zhou discovered that a race condition existed in the infrared receiver/transceiver driver in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after- free vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-1118)",
