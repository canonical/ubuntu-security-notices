  "details": "Robert Merget, Marcus Brinkmann, Nimrod Aviram, and Juraj Somorovsky\ndiscovered that certain Diffie-Hellman ciphersuites in the TLS\nspecification and implemented by OpenSSL contained a flaw. A remote\nattacker could possibly use this issue to eavesdrop on encrypted\ncommunications. This was fixed in this update by removing the insecure\nciphersuites from OpenSSL. (CVE-2020-1968)\n\nPaul Kehrer discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain input\nlengths in EVP functions. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue\nto cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n(CVE-2021-23840)\n\nElison Niven discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled the c_rehash\nscript. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary\ncommands when c_rehash is run. (CVE-2022-1292)\n\nChancen and Daniel Fiala discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled the\nc_rehash script. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to execute\narbitrary commands when c_rehash is run. (CVE-2022-2068)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled excessively large\nDiffie-Hellman parameters. An attacker could possibly use this issue\nto cause a denial of service. (CVE-2023-3446)\n\nBahaa Naamneh discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain malformed\nPKCS12 files. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause\nOpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2024-0727)\n",
