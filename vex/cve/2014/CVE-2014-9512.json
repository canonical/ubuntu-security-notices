CVE Notes / justification: rsync 3.1.1 introduced invalid filename filtering to prevent malicious servers from sending files outside of the specified directory: https://git.samba.org/?p=rsync.git;a=commit;h=4cad402ea8a91031f86c53961d78bb7f4f174790  CVE-2014-9512 is about malicious servers being able to bypass that filtering by changing paths.  This is a security hardening feature that was added in 3.1.1. Either the whole feature needs to be backported to versions earlier than 3.1.1, or this issue doesn't apply to them.  a second commit was later added: https://git.samba.org/rsync.git/?p=rsync.git;a=commit;h=e12a6c087ca1eecdb8eae5977be239c24f4dd3d9 packages in vivid+ claim that this CVE is fixed, but are missing the second commit"
