        "description": "It was discovered that OpenCV did not properly manage certain XML data, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. If a user were tricked into loading a specially crafted file, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to make OpenCV crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2019-14493)  It was discovered that OpenCV may perform out-of-bounds reads in certain situations. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenCV to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or the execution of arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2019-16249, CVE-2019-19624)  It was discovered that the QR code module of OpenCV incorrectly processed certain maliciously crafted QR codes. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenCV to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2023-2617, CVE-2023-2618)",
