  "summary": "linux-oem-6.1 vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the Traffic-Control Index (TCINDEX) implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not properly perform filter deactivation in some\nsituations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated\nprivileges. Please note that with the fix for this CVE, kernel support for\nthe TCINDEX classifier has been removed. (CVE-2023-1829)\n\nWilliam Zhao discovered that the Traffic Control (TC) subsystem in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle network packet retransmission in\ncertain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (kernel deadlock). (CVE-2022-4269)\n\nThadeu Cascardo discovered that the io_uring subsystem contained a double-\nfree vulnerability in certain memory allocation error conditions. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2023-1032)\n\nIt was discovered that the TUN/TAP driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly initialize socket data. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1076)\n\nIt was discovered that the Real-Time Scheduling Class implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-1077)\n\nIt was discovered that the ASUS HID driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle device removal, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.\nA local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB\ndevice to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1079)\n\nIt was discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly perform file table updates in some situations, leading to a null\npointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause\na denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1583)\n\nIt was discovered that the Xircom PCMCIA network device driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle device removal events. A physically\nproximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2023-1670)\n\nIt was discovered that the APM X-Gene SoC hardware monitoring driver in the\nLinux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2023-1855)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Bluetooth HCI SDIO\ndriver, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1989)\n\nIt was discovered that the ST NCI NFC driver did not properly handle device\nremoval events. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1990)\n\nJose Oliveira and Rodrigo Branco discovered that the Spectre Variant 2\nmitigations with prctl syscall were insufficient in some situations. A\nlocal attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2023-1998)\n\nIt was discovered that the BigBen Interactive Kids' gamepad driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle device removal, leading to a use-\nafter-free vulnerability. A local attacker with physical access could plug\nin a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2023-25012)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the TLS subsystem in the\nLinux kernel, leading to a use-after-free or a null pointer dereference\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-28466)\n\nIt was discovered that the Bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly initialize some data structures, leading to an out-of-bounds\naccess vulnerability in certain situations. An attacker could use this to\nexpose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-28866)\n\nReima Ishii discovered that the nested KVM implementation for Intel x86\nprocessors in the Linux kernel did not properly validate control registers\nin certain situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (guest crash). (CVE-2023-30456)\n\nDuoming Zhou discovered that a race condition existed in the infrared\nreceiver/transceiver driver in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-\nfree vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-1118)\n\n",
