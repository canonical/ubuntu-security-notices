  "description": "Florian Weimer discovered that the delegate code did not correctly\nhandle file names which embed shell commands (CVE-2005-4601). Daniel\nKobras found a format string vulnerability in the SetImageInfo()\nfunction (CVE-2006-0082). By tricking a user into processing an image\nfile with a specially crafted file name, these two vulnerabilities\ncould be exploited to execute arbitrary commands with the user's\nprivileges. These vulnerability become particularly critical if\nmalicious images are sent as email attachments and the email client\nuses imagemagick to convert/display the images (e. g. Thunderbird and\nGnus).\n\nIn addition, Eero H\u00e4kkinen reported a bug in the command line argument\nprocessing of the 'display' command. Arguments that contained\nwildcards and were expanded to several files could trigger a heap\noverflow. However, there is no known possiblity to exploit this\nremotely.
