This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux\nHardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 for Ubuntu\n12.04 ESM.\n\nIt was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU\ncore may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU\ncore. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local\nattacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation (memory from other guests or the host OS). (CVE-2018-3646)\n\nIt was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU\ncore may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU\ncore. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information (memory from the\nkernel or other processes). (CVE-2018-3620)\n\nAndrey Konovalov discovered an out-of-bounds read in the POSIX timers\nsubsystem in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2017-18344)\n\nJuha-Matti Tilli discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel\nperformed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when\nhandling incoming packets.
