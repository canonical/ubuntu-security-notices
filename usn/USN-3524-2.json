This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux\nHardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for Ubuntu\n12.04 ESM.\n\nJann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution\nand indirect branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory reads via\nsidechannel attacks. This flaw is known as Meltdown. A local attacker could\nuse this to expose sensitive information, including kernel memory.\n",
