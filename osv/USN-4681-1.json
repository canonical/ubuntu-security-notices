  "details": "Ryan Hall discovered that the Intel 700 Series Ethernet Controllers driver\nin the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some conditions.\nA local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory\nexhaustion). (CVE-2019-0148)\n\nIt was discovered that the console keyboard driver in the Linux kernel\ncontained a race condition. A local attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-25656)\n\nMinh Yuan discovered that the tty driver in the Linux kernel contained race\nconditions when handling fonts. A local attacker could possibly use this to\nexpose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-25668)\n\nJinoh Kang discovered that the Xen event channel infrastructure in the\nLinux kernel contained a race condition. An attacker in guest could\npossibly use this to cause a denial of service (dom0 crash).\n(CVE-2020-27675)\n\nMinh Yuan discovered that the framebuffer console driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle fonts in some conditions. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexpose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-28974)\n\nIt was discovered that Power 9 processors could be coerced to expose\ninformation from the L1 cache in certain situations. A local attacker could\nuse this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-4788)\n",
