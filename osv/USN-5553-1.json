An\nattacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2020-14152)\n\nIt was discovered that libjpeg-turbo was not properly setting variable sizes\nwhen performing certain kinds of encoding operations, which could lead to a\nstack-based buffer overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into\nopening a specially crafted file, an attacker could possibly use this issue to\ncause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-17541)\n",
