  "details": "USN-3695-2 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux Hardware Enablement\nKernel (HWE) kernel for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Unfortunately, the fix\nfor CVE-2018-1108 introduced a regression where insufficient early\nentropy prevented services from starting, leading in some situations\nto a failure to boot, This update addresses the issue.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel's implementation of random\n seed data reported that it was in a ready state before it had gathered\n sufficient entropy. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive\n information. (CVE-2018-1108)\n\n Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux\n kernel did not properly initialize the crc32c checksum driver. A local\n attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n (CVE-2018-1094)\n\n It was discovered that the cdrom driver in the Linux kernel contained an\n incorrect bounds check. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive\n information (kernel memory). (CVE-2018-10940)\n\n Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux\n kernel did not properly validate xattr sizes. A local attacker could use\n this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-1095)\n\n Jann Horn discovered that the 32 bit adjtimex() syscall implementation for\n 64 bit Linux kernels did not properly initialize memory returned to user\n space in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose\n sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2018-11508)\n\n It was discovered that an information leak vulnerability existed in the\n floppy driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\n expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2018-7755)\n",
