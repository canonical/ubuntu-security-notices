  "details": "Several out-of-bounds write bugs were discovered in Skia. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application\ncrash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking\nthe program. (CVE-2015-1213, CVE-2015-1214, CVE-2015-1215)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in the V8 bindings in Blink. If a user\nwere tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash,\nor execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render\nprocess. (CVE-2015-1216)\n\nMultiple type confusion bugs were discovered in the V8 bindings in Blink.\nIf a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an\nattacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via\nrenderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nsandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1217, CVE-2015-1230)\n\nMultiple use-after-free bugs were discovered in the DOM implementation in\nBlink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,\nan attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service\nvia renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nsandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1218, CVE-2015-1223)\n\nAn integer overflow was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.\n(CVE-2015-1219)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in the GIF image decoder in Blink. If a\nuser were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker\ncould potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer\ncrash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed\nrender process. (CVE-2015-1220)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\nexploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process.\n(CVE-2015-1221)\n\nMultiple use-after-free bugs were discovered in the service worker\nimplementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a\nspecially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these\nto cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1222)\n\nAn out-of-bounds read was discovered in the VPX decoder implementation in\nChromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\nwebsite, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of\nservice via renderer crash. (CVE-2015-1224)\n\nIt was discovered that Blink did not initialize memory for image drawing\nin some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially\ncrafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to read\nuninitialized memory. (CVE-2015-1227)\n\nIt was discovered that Blink did not initialize memory for a data\nstructure in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a\nspecially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\ncause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code\nwith the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1228)\n\nIt was discovered that a web proxy returning a 407 response could inject\ncookies in to the originally requested domain. If a user connected to a\nmalicious web proxy, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct\nsession-fixation attacks. (CVE-2015-1229)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial\nof service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1231)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked\nin to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\nexploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via\nrenderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nsandboxed render process.
