  "details": "Jann Horn and Ken Johnson discovered that microprocessors utilizing\nspeculative execution of a memory read may allow unauthorized memory\nreads via a sidechannel attack. This flaw is known as Spectre\nVariant 4. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation, including kernel memory. (CVE-2018-3639)\n\nJan H. Sch\u00f6nherr discovered that the Xen subsystem did not properly handle\nblock IO merges correctly in some situations. An attacker in a guest vm\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (host crash) or possibly gain\nadministrative privileges in the host. (CVE-2017-12134)\n\nIt was discovered that the Bluetooth HIP Protocol implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate HID connection setup information. An\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-13220)\n\nIt was discovered that a buffer overread vulnerability existed in the\nkeyring subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use\nthis to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2017-13305)\n\nIt was discovered that the netlink subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly restrict observations of netlink messages to the appropriate net\nnamespace. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information\n(kernel netlink traffic). (CVE-2017-17449)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the i8042 serial device\ndriver implementation in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-18079)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Device Mapper\ncomponent of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-18203)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the OCFS2 file system\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). (CVE-2017-18204)\n\nIt was discovered that an infinite loop could occur in the madvise(2)\nimplementation in the Linux kernel in certain circumstances. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system hang).\n(CVE-2017-18208)\n\nKefeng Wang discovered that a race condition existed in the memory locking\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service. (CVE-2017-18221)\n\nSilvio Cesare discovered a buffer overwrite existed in the NCPFS\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker controlling a\nmalicious NCPFS server could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-8822)\n",
