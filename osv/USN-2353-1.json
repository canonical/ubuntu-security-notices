  "summary": "apt vulnerability",
  "details": "It was discovered that APT incorrectly handled certain http URLs. If a\nremote attacker were able to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw\ncould be exploited to cause APT to crash, resulting in a denial of service,\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. The default compiler options for\naffected releases should reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service.\n(CVE-2014-6273)\n\nIn addition, this update fixes regressions introduced by the USN-2348-1\nsecurity update: APT incorrectly handled file:/// sources on a different\npartition, incorrectly handled Dir::state::lists set to a relative path,\nand incorrectly handled cdrom: sources.\n",
