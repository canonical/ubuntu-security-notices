  "summary": "linux-aws, linux-aws-5.4 vulnerabilities",
  "details": "Wenqing Liu discovered that the f2fs file system implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate inode types while performing garbage\ncollection. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious f2fs image\nthat, when mounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2021-44879)\n\nIt was discovered that the DesignWare USB3 for Qualcomm SoCs driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions during device\nregistration. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2023-22995)\n\nBien Pham discovered that the netfiler subsystem in the Linux kernel\ncontained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nlocal user could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-4244)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Bluetooth subsystem\nof the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-51779)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the ATM (Asynchronous\nTransfer Mode) subsystem of the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-51780)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Rose X.25 protocol\nimplementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after- free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-51782)\n\nAlon Zahavi discovered that the NVMe-oF/TCP subsystem of the Linux kernel\ndid not properly handle connect command payloads in certain situations,\nleading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could use\nthis to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-6121)\n\nIt was discovered that the VirtIO subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly initialize memory in some situations. A local attacker could use\nthis to possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2024-0340)\n",
