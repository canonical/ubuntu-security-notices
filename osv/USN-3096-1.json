  "details": "Aanchal Malhotra discovered that NTP incorrectly handled authenticated\nbroadcast mode. A remote attacker could use this issue to perform a replay\nattack. (CVE-2015-7973)\n\nMatt Street discovered that NTP incorrectly verified peer associations of\nsymmetric keys. A remote attacker could use this issue to perform an\nimpersonation attack. (CVE-2015-7974)\n\nJonathan Gardner discovered that the NTP ntpq utility incorrectly handled\nmemory. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause ntpq to crash,\nresulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04\nLTS. (CVE-2015-7975)\n\nJonathan Gardner discovered that the NTP ntpq utility incorrectly handled\ndangerous characters in filenames. An attacker could possibly use this\nissue to overwrite arbitrary files. (CVE-2015-7976)\n\nStephen Gray discovered that NTP incorrectly handled large restrict lists.\nAn attacker could use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2015-7977, CVE-2015-7978)\n\nAanchal Malhotra discovered that NTP incorrectly handled authenticated\nbroadcast mode. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause NTP to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-7979)\n\nJonathan Gardner discovered that NTP incorrectly handled origin timestamp\nchecks. A remote attacker could use this issue to spoof peer servers.\n(CVE-2015-8138)\n\nJonathan Gardner discovered that the NTP ntpq utility did not properly\nhandle certain incorrect values. An attacker could possibly use this issue\nto cause ntpq to hang, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-8158)\n\nIt was discovered that the NTP cronjob incorrectly cleaned up the\nstatistics directory. A local attacker could possibly use this to escalate\nprivileges. (CVE-2016-0727)\n\nStephen Gray and Matthew Van Gundy discovered that NTP incorrectly\nvalidated crypto-NAKs. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to\nprevent clients from synchronizing. (CVE-2016-1547)\n\nMiroslav Lichvar and Jonathan Gardner discovered that NTP incorrectly\nhandled switching to interleaved symmetric mode. A remote attacker could\npossibly use this issue to prevent clients from synchronizing.\n(CVE-2016-1548)\n\nMatthew Van Gundy, Stephen Gray and Loganaden Velvindron discovered that\nNTP incorrectly handled message authentication. A remote attacker could\npossibly use this issue to recover the message digest key. (CVE-2016-1550)\n\nYihan Lian discovered that NTP incorrectly handled duplicate IPs on\nunconfig directives. An authenticated remote attacker could possibly use\nthis issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n(CVE-2016-2516)\n\nYihan Lian discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certail peer\nassociations. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP\nto crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-2518)\n\nJakub Prokes discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain spoofed\npackets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial\nof service. (CVE-2016-4954)\n\nMiroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain packets\nwhen autokey is enabled. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to\ncause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-4955)\n\nMiroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain spoofed\nbroadcast packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to\ncause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-4956)\n\nIn the default installation, attackers would be isolated by the NTP\nAppArmor profile.\n",
