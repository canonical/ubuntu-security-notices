If a user or\nautomated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted bmp file, a\nremote attacker could use this flaw to cause GDK-PixBuf to crash, resulting\nin a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only\naffected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2015-7552)\n\nIt was discovered that the GDK-PixBuf library contained an integer overflow\nwhen handling certain images. If a user or automated system were tricked into\nopening a crafted image file, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause\nGDK-PixBuf to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute\narbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2015-8875)\n\nFranco Costantini discovered that the GDK-PixBuf library contained an \nout-of-bounds write error when parsing an ico file. If a user or automated\nsystem were tricked into opening a crafted ico file, a remote attacker could\nuse this flaw to cause GDK-PixBuf to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\nThis issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
