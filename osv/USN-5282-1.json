An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a buffer overflow,\nresulting in a denial of service, or arbitrary code execution. This issue\nonly affected Ubuntu 16.04 ESM and Ubuntu 18.04 ESM. (CVE-2019-14267)\n\nIt was discovered that PDFResurrect incorrectly handled memory when loading\nPDF pages. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a heap\nbuffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.\nThis issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 ESM and Ubuntu 18.04 ESM.\n(CVE-2019-14934)\n\nIt was discovered that PDFResurrect was incorrectly validating header data in\ninput PDF files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a heap\nbuffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.\nThis issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 ESM, Ubuntu 18.04 ESM and Ubuntu 20.04 ESM.\n(CVE-2020-20740)\n\nCarter Yagemann discovered that PDFResurrect incorrectly handled certain memory\noperations during PDF summary generation. An attacker could use this to\ncause out-of-bounds writes, resulting in a denial of service (system crash)\nor arbitrary code execution. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 ESM and\nUbuntu 20.04 ESM. (CVE-2020-9549)\n\nIt was discovered that PDFResurrect was incorrectly processing data when\nperforming trailer search operations. An attacker could possibly use this issue\nto cause an infinite loop, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2021-3508)\n",
