  "details": "It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly initialize a Wake-\non-Lan data structure. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation (kernel memory). (CVE-2014-9900)\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly restrict access to\n/proc/iomem. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2015-8944)\n\nAlexander Potapenko discovered a race condition in the Advanced Linux Sound\nArchitecture (ALSA) subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could\nuse this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2017-1000380)\n\nLi Qiang discovered that the DRM driver for VMware Virtual GPUs in the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate some ioctl arguments. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2017-7346)\n\nJann Horn discovered that bpf in Linux kernel does not restrict the output\nof the print_bpf_insn function. A local attacker could use this to obtain\nsensitive address information. (CVE-2017-9150)\n\nMurray McAllister discovered that the DRM driver for VMware Virtual GPUs in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory. A local attacker could\nuse this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2017-9605)\n",
