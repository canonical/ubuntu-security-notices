  "description": "It was discovered that the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) implementation\nin the Linux kernel contained a race condition when releasing PPPoL2TP\nsockets in certain conditions, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-20567)\n\nIt was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle block device modification while it is\nmounted. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-34256)\n\nEric Dumazet discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly handle DCCP conntrack buffers in certain situations,\nleading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. An attacker could possibly\nuse this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-39197)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the AppleTalk networking\nsubsystem of the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-51781)\n\nIt was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle the remount operation in certain cases,\nleading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2024-0775)\n\nNotselwyn discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle verdict parameters in certain cases, leading to a use-\nafter-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2024-1086)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the SCSI Emulex\nLightPulse Fibre Channel driver in the Linux kernel when unregistering FCF\nand re-scanning an HBA FCF table, leading to a null pointer dereference\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2024-24855)\n",
