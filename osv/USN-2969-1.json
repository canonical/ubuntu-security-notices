  "details": "Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Aiptek Tablet USB device driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the\ndevice. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2015-7515)\n\nBen Hawkes discovered that the Linux kernel's AIO interface allowed single\nwrites greater than 2GB, which could cause an integer overflow when writing\nto certain filesystems, socket or device types. A local attacker could this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2015-8830)\n\nZach Riggle discovered that the Linux kernel's list poison feature did not\ntake into account the mmap_min_addr value. A local attacker could use this\nto bypass the kernel's poison-pointer protection mechanism while attempting\nto exploit an existing kernel vulnerability. (CVE-2016-0821)\n\nRalf Spenneberg discovered that the USB sound subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical\naccess could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2016-2184)\n\nRalf Spenneberg discovered that the ATI Wonder Remote II USB driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker\nwith physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2016-2185)\n\nRalf Spenneberg discovered that the PowerMate USB driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with\nphysical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2016-2186)\n\nRalf Spenneberg discovered that the I/O-Warrior USB device driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker\nwith physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2016-2188)\n\nSergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the\nUSB abstract device control driver for modems and ISDN adapters did not\nvalidate endpoint descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-3138)\n\nIt was discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nperform the destruction of inet device objects properly. An attacker in a\nguest OS could use this to cause a denial of service (networking outage) in\nthe host OS. (CVE-2016-3156)\n\nAndy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly context-\nswitch IOPL on 64-bit PV Xen guests. An attacker in a guest OS could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash), gain privileges, or\nobtain sensitive information. (CVE-2016-3157)\n",
