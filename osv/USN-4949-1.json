  "summary": "linux, linux-aws, linux-azure, linux-gcp, linux-hwe-5.8, linux-kvm, linux-oracle, linux-raspi vulnerabilities",
  "details": "Ryota Shiga discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly verify that a BPF program only reserved as much memory for a\nring buffer as was allocated. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3489)\n\nManfred Paul discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly track bounds on bitwise operations. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2021-3490)\n\nBilly Jheng Bing-Jhong discovered that the io_uring implementation of the\nLinux kernel did not properly enforce the MAX_RW_COUNT limit in some\nsituations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3491)\n\nIt was discovered that the Nouveau GPU driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle error conditions in some situations. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-25639)\n\nOlivier Benjamin, Norbert Manthey, Martin Mazein, and Jan H. Sch\u00f6nherr\ndiscovered that the Xen paravirtualization backend in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly propagate errors to frontend drivers in some situations. An\nattacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service\n(host domain crash). (CVE-2021-26930)\n\nJan Beulich discovered that multiple Xen backends in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle certain error conditions under paravirtualization. An\nattacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service\n(host domain crash). (CVE-2021-26931)\n\nIt was discovered that the fastrpc driver in the Linux kernel did not\nprevent user space applications from sending kernel RPC messages. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges.\n(CVE-2021-28375)\n\nIt was discovered that the Freescale Gianfar Ethernet driver for the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle receive queue overrun when jumbo frames were\nenabled in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2021-29264)\n\nIt was discovered that the USB/IP driver in the Linux kernel contained race\nconditions during the update of local and shared status. An attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-29265)\n\nIt was discovered that the vDPA backend virtio driver in the Linux kernel\ncontained a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2021-29266)\n\nIt was discovered that the TIPC protocol implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate passed encryption key sizes. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2021-29646)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the netfilter subsystem\nof the Linux kernel when replacing tables. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-29650)\n",
