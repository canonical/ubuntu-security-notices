  "details": "It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel, when\nparavirtual TLB flushes are enabled in guests, the hypervisor in some\nsituations could miss deferred TLB flushes or otherwise mishandle them. An\nattacker in a guest VM could use this to expose sensitive information (read\nmemory from another guest VM). (CVE-2019-3016)\n\nPaulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the\nLinux kernel could improperly let a nested (level 2) guest access the\nresources of a parent (level 1) guest in certain situations. An attacker\ncould use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-2732)\n\nIt was discovered that the RPMSG character device interface in the Linux\nkernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A\nlocal attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel\nmemory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19053)\n\nIt was discovered that the Marvell Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local\nattacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of service (kernel\nmemory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19056)\n\nIt was discovered that the Intel(R) Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux kernel\ndevice driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in\ncertain error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause\na denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19058,\nCVE-2019-19059)\n\nIt was discovered that the Brocade BFA Fibre Channel device driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error\nconditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of\nservice (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19066)\n\nIt was discovered that the Realtek RTL8xxx USB Wi-Fi device driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error\nconditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of\nservice (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19068)\n",
