  "details": "It was discovered that debugfs in the Linux kernel as used by blktrace\ncontained a use-after-free in some situations. A privileged local attacker\ncould possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2019-19770)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the binder IPC\nimplementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-0423)\n\nDaniele Antonioli, Nils Ole Tippenhauer, and Kasper Rasmussen discovered\nthat legacy pairing and secure-connections pairing authentication in the\nBluetooth protocol could allow an unauthenticated user to complete\nauthentication without pairing credentials via adjacent access. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to impersonate a previously\npaired Bluetooth device. (CVE-2020-10135)\n\nIt was discovered that the console keyboard driver in the Linux kernel\ncontained a race condition. A local attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-25656)\n\nMinh Yuan discovered that the tty driver in the Linux kernel contained race\nconditions when handling fonts. A local attacker could possibly use this to\nexpose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-25668)\n\nKeyu Man discovered that the ICMP global rate limiter in the Linux kernel\ncould be used to assist in scanning open UDP ports. A remote attacker could\nuse to facilitate attacks on UDP based services that depend on source port\nrandomization. (CVE-2020-25705)\n\nJinoh Kang discovered that the Xen event channel infrastructure in the\nLinux kernel contained a race condition. An attacker in guest could\npossibly use this to cause a denial of service (dom0 crash).\n(CVE-2020-27675)\n\nDaniel Axtens discovered that PowerPC RTAS implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly restrict memory accesses in some situations. A\nprivileged local attacker could use this to arbitrarily modify kernel\nmemory, potentially bypassing kernel lockdown restrictions.\n(CVE-2020-27777)\n\nMinh Yuan discovered that the framebuffer console driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle fonts in some conditions. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexpose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-28974)\n",
