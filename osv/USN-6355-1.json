  "details": "Daniel Axtens discovered that specially crafted images could cause a\nheap-based out-of-bonds write. A local attacker could possibly use\nthis to circumvent secure boot protections. (CVE-2021-3695)\n\nDaniel Axtens discovered that specially crafted images could cause\nout-of-bonds read and write. A local attacker could possibly use this\nto circumvent secure boot protections. (CVE-2021-3696)\n\nDaniel Axtens discovered that specially crafted images could cause\nbuffer underwrite which allows arbitrary data to be written to a heap.\nA local attacker could possibly use this to circumvent secure\nboot protections. (CVE-2021-3697)\n\nIt was discovered that GRUB2 configuration files were created with\nthe wrong permissions. An attacker could possibly use this to leak\nencrypted passwords. (CVE-2021-3981)\n\nDaniel Axtens discovered that specially crafted IP packets could cause\nan integer underflow and write past the end of a buffer. An attacker\ncould possibly use this to circumvent secure boot protections.\n(CVE-2022-28733)\n\nDaniel Axtens discovered that specially crafted HTTP headers can cause\nan out-of-bounds write of a NULL byte. An attacker could possibly use\nthis to corrupt GRUB2's internal data. (CVE-2022-28734)\n\nJulian Andres Klode discovered that GRUB2 shim_lock allowed non-\nkernel files to be loaded. A local attack could possibly use this to\ncircumvent secure boot protections. (CVE-2022-28735)\n\nChris Coulson discovered that executing chainloaders more than once\ncaused a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attack could possibly\nuse this to circumvent secure boot protections. (CVE-2022-28736)\n\nChris Coulson discovered that specially crafted executables could\ncause shim to make out-of-bound writes. A local attack could possibly\nuse this to circumvent secure boot protections. (CVE-2022-28737)\n\nZhang Boyang discovered that specially crafted unicode sequences\ncould lead to an out-of-bounds write to a heap. A local attacker could\npossibly use this to circumvent secure boot protections.\n(CVE-2022-3775)\n",
