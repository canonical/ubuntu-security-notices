  "summary": "openjdk-8, openjdk-lts vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the Security component of OpenJDK did not properly\nensure that manifest elements were signed before use. An attacker could\npossibly use this to specially construct an untrusted Java application or\napplet that could escape sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2018-3136)\n\nArtem Smotrakov discovered that the HTTP client redirection handler\nimplementation in OpenJDK did not clear potentially sensitive information\nin HTTP headers when following redirections to different hosts. An attacker\ncould use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-3139)\n\nIt was discovered that the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI)\nimplementation in OpenJDK did not properly enforce restrictions specified\nby system properties in some situations. An attacker could potentially use\nthis to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-3149)\n\nIt was discovered that the Utility component of OpenJDK did not properly\nensure all attributes in a JAR were signed before use. An attacker could\nuse this to specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet\nthat could escape sandbox restrictions. This issue only affected Ubuntu\n18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.10. (CVE-2018-3150)\n\nIt was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not properly\nperform access checks in certain cases when performing field link\nresolution. An attacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted\nJava application or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions.\n(CVE-2018-3169)\n\nFelix D\u00f6rre discovered that the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE)\nimplementation in OpenJDK did not ensure that the same endpoint\nidentification algorithm was used during TLS session resumption as during\ninitial session setup. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2018-3180)\n\nKrzysztof Szafra\u0144ski discovered that the Scripting component did not\nproperly restrict access to the scripting engine in some situations. An\nattacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted Java\napplication or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions.\n(CVE-2018-3183)\n\nTobias Ospelt discovered that the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF)\nreader implementation in OpenJDK contained an infinite loop. An attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected\nUbuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2018-3214)\n",
