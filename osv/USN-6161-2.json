  "details": "USN-6161-1 fixed vulnerabilities in .NET. The update introduced\na regression with regards to how the runtime imported X.509\ncertificates. This update fixes the problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that .NET did not properly enforce certain\n restrictions when deserializing a DataSet or DataTable from\n XML. An attacker could possibly use this issue to elevate their\n privileges. (CVE-2023-24936)\n\n Kevin Jones discovered that .NET did not properly handle the\n AIA fetching process for X.509 client certificates. An attacker\n could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.\n (CVE-2023-29331)\n\n Kalle Niemitalo discovered that the .NET package manager,\n NuGet, was susceptible to a potential race condition. An\n attacker could possibly use this issue to perform remote\n code execution. (CVE-2023-29337)\n\n Tom Deseyn discovered that .NET did not properly process certain\n arguments when extracting the contents of a tar file. An attacker\n could possibly use this issue to elevate their privileges. This\n issue only affected the dotnet7 package. (CVE-2023-32032)\n\n It was discovered that .NET did not properly handle memory in\n certain circumstances. An attacker could possibly use this issue\n to cause a denial of service or perform remote code execution.\n (CVE-2023-33128)\n",
