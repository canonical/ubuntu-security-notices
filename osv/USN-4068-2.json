  "details": "USN-4068-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu\n18.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the\nLinux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 18.04 for Ubuntu\n16.04 LTS.\n\nAdam Zabrocki discovered that the Intel i915 kernel mode graphics driver in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly restrict mmap() ranges in some\nsituations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-11085)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition leading to a use-after-free existed\nin the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol implementation in the Linux\nkernel. The RDS protocol is disabled via blocklist by default in Ubuntu. \nIf enabled, a local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-11815)\n\nIt was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly zero out memory in some situations. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2019-11833)\n\nIt was discovered that the Bluetooth Human Interface Device Protocol (HIDP)\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not properly verify strings were\nNULL terminated in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to\nexpose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-11884)\n",
