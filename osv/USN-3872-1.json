  "details": "It was discovered that a race condition existed in the vsock address family\nimplementation of the Linux kernel that could lead to a use-after-free\ncondition. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to\nexpose sensitive information (host machine kernel memory). (CVE-2018-14625)\n\nCfir Cohen discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the\nKVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in\nenvironments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM\nvirtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local\nattacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative\nprivileges in a host machine. (CVE-2018-16882)\n\nWei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-19407)\n\nIt was discovered that the crypto subsystem of the Linux kernel leaked\nuninitialized memory to user space in some situations. A local attacker\ncould use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2018-19854)\n",
