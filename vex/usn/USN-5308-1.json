If libssh2 were used to connect to a malicious or compromised SSH server, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code on the client  system. (CVE-2019-3855)  It was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled prompt requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-3856)  It was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial of service, or obtain sensitive information.  (CVE-2019-3857, CVE-2019-3862)  It was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled specially crafted SFTP packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2019-3858)  It was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled certain specially crafted packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2019-3859)  It was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled SFTP packets with empty payloads. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2019-3860)  It was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled padding values in SSH packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2019-3861)  It was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled interactive response messages length. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-3863)  It was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled the Diffie Hellman key exchange. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2019-13115)  It was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled bound checks in SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2019-17498)",
