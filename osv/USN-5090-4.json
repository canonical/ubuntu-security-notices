  "details": "USN-5090-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Apache HTTP Server. One of the upstream\nfixes introduced a regression in UDS URIs. This update fixes the problem.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n James Kettle discovered that the Apache HTTP Server HTTP/2 module\n incorrectly handled certain crafted methods. A remote attacker could\n possibly use this issue to perform request splitting or cache poisoning\n attacks. (CVE-2021-33193)\n \n It was discovered that the Apache HTTP Server incorrectly handled certain\n malformed requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to\n cause the server to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n (CVE-2021-34798)\n \n Li Zhi Xin discovered that the Apache mod_proxy_uwsgi module incorrectly\n handled certain request uri-paths. A remote attacker could possibly use\n this issue to cause the server to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 21.04.\n (CVE-2021-36160)\n \n It was discovered that the Apache HTTP Server incorrectly handled escaping\n quotes. If the server was configured with third-party modules, a remote\n attacker could use this issue to cause the server to crash, resulting in a\n denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-39275)\n \n It was discovered that the Apache mod_proxy module incorrectly handled\n certain request uri-paths. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue\n to cause the server to forward requests to arbitrary origin servers.\n (CVE-2021-40438)\n",
