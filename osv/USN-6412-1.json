  "details": "Hyunwoo Kim discovered that the DVB Core driver in the Linux kernel\ncontained a race condition during device removal, leading to a use-after-\nfree vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause\na denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2022-45886, CVE-2022-45919)\n\nHyunwoo Kim discovered that the Technotrend/Hauppauge USB DEC driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle device removal events. A physically\nproximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2022-45887)\n\nIt was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate MFT flags in certain situations. An\nattacker could use this to construct a malicious NTFS image that, when\nmounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2022-48425)\n\nIt was discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel\ncontained a high rate of hash collisions in connection lookup table. A\nremote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (excessive CPU\nconsumption). (CVE-2023-1206)\n\nDani\u00ebl Trujillo, Johannes Wikner, and Kaveh Razavi discovered that some AMD\nprocessors utilising speculative execution and branch prediction may allow\nunauthorised memory reads via a speculative side-channel attack. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel\nmemory. (CVE-2023-20569)\n\nIt was discovered that the IPv6 RPL protocol implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle user-supplied data. A remote attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-2156)\n\nYang Lan discovered that the GFS2 file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel could attempt to dereference a null pointer in some situations. An\nattacker could use this to construct a malicious GFS2 image that, when\nmounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-3212)\n\nIt was discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly validate buffer sizes in certain operations, leading to an integer\nunderflow and out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2023-38427)\n\nChih-Yen Chang discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate packet header sizes in certain situations,\nleading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2023-38431)\n\nAndy Nguyen discovered that the KVM implementation for AMD processors in\nthe Linux kernel with Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) contained a\nrace condition when accessing the GHCB page. A local attacker in a SEV\nguest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host system\ncrash). (CVE-2023-4155)\n\nIt was discovered that the TUN/TAP driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly initialize socket data. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-4194)\n\nMaxim Suhanov discovered that the exFAT file system implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly check a file name length, leading to an out-\nof-bounds write vulnerability. An attacker could use this to construct a\nmalicious exFAT image that, when mounted and operated on, could cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-4273)\n\n",
