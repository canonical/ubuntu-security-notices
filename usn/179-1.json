  "description": "The current default algorithm for creating \"message digests\"\n(electronic signatures) for certificates created by openssl is MD5.\nHowever, this algorithm is not deemed secure any more, and some\npractical attacks have been demonstrated which could allow an attacker\nto forge certificates with a valid certification authority signature\neven if he does not know the secret CA signing key.\n\nTherefore all Ubuntu versions of openssl have now been changed to use\nSHA-1 by default. This is a more appropriate default algorithm for\nthe majority of use cases; however, if you still want to use MD5 as\ndefault, you can revert this change by changing the two instances of\n\"default_md = sha1\" to \"default_md = md5\" in /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf.\n\nA detailed explanation and further links can be found at\n\n  http://www.cits.rub.de/MD5Collisions/",
