An attacker could specially craft a cpio archive that could create a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-9112)  Jakob Lell discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the rmt_read__ function of GNU cpio's rmt client functionality. An attacker controlling a remote rmt server could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. (CVE-2010-0624)",
