  "details": "\nAndy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle\nfaults associated with the Stack Segment (SS) register in the x86\narchitecture. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to gain\nadministrative privileges. (CVE-2014-9322)\n\nAn information leak in the Linux kernel was discovered that could leak the\nhigh 16 bits of the kernel stack address on 32-bit Kernel Virtual Machine\n(KVM) paravirt guests. A user in the guest OS could exploit this leak to\nobtain information that could potentially be used to aid in attacking the\nkernel. (CVE-2014-8134)\n\nRabin Vincent, Robert Swiecki, Russell King discovered that the ftrace\nsubsystem of the Linux kernel does not properly handle private syscall\nnumbers. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service\n(OOPS). (CVE-2014-7826)\n\nA flaw in the handling of malformed ASCONF chunks by SCTP (Stream Control\nTransmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel was discovered. A\nremote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2014-3673)\n\nA flaw in the handling of duplicate ASCONF chunks by SCTP (Stream Control\nTransmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel was discovered. A\nremote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service\n(panic). (CVE-2014-3687)\n\nIt was discovered that excessive queuing by SCTP (Stream Control\nTransmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel can cause memory\npressure. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2014-3688)\n\nRabin Vincent, Robert Swiecki, Russell Kinglaw discovered a flaw in how the\nperf subsystem of the Linux kernel handles private systecall numbers. A\nlocal user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (OOPS) or bypass\nASLR protections via a crafted application. (CVE-2014-7825)\n\nThe KVM (kernel virtual machine) subsystem of the Linux kernel\nmiscalculates the number of memory pages during the handling of a mapping\nfailure. A guest OS user could exploit this to cause a denial of service\n(host OS page unpinning) or possibly have unspecified other impact by\nleveraging guest OS privileges. (CVE-2014-8369)\n\nAndy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle\nfaults associated with the Stack Segment (SS) register on the x86\narchitecture. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of\nservice (panic). (CVE-2014-9090)\n",
