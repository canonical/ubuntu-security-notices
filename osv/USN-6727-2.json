  "details": "USN-6727-1 fixed vulnerabilities in NSS. The update introduced a regression\nwhen trying to load security modules on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.04\nLTS. This update fixes the problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that NSS incorrectly handled padding when checking PKCS#1\n certificates. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform\n Bleichenbacher-like attacks and recover private data. This issue only\n affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2023-4421)\n \n It was discovered that NSS had a timing side-channel when performing RSA\n decryption. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to recover\n private data. (CVE-2023-5388)\n \n It was discovered that NSS had a timing side-channel when using certain\n NIST curves. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to recover\n private data. (CVE-2023-6135)\n \n The NSS package contained outdated CA certificates. This update refreshes\n the NSS package to version 3.98 which includes the latest CA certificate\n bundle and other security improvements.\n",
