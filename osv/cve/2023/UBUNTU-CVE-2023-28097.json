  "details": "OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation. Prior to versions 3.1.9 and 3.2.6, a malformed SIP message containing a large _Content-Length_ value and a specially crafted Request-URI causes a segmentation fault in OpenSIPS. This issue occurs when a large amount of shared memory using the `-m` flag was allocated to OpenSIPS, such as 10 GB of RAM. On the test system, this issue occurred when shared memory was set to `2362` or higher. This issue is fixed in versions 3.1.9 and 3.2.6. The only workaround is to guarantee that the Content-Length value of input messages is never larger than `2147483647`.",
