  "description": "USN-3822-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 14.04\nLTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux\nHardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for Ubuntu\n12.04 ESM.\n\nJim Mattson discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel\nmismanages the #BP and #OF exceptions. A local attacker in a guest virtual\nmachine could use this to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash).\n(CVE-2016-9588)\n\nIt was discovered that the generic SCSI driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly enforce permissions on kernel memory access. A local attacker\ncould use this to expose sensitive information or possibly elevate\nprivileges. (CVE-2017-13168)\n\nAndrey Konovalov discovered that the CDC USB Ethernet driver did not\nproperly validate device descriptors. A physically proximate attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-16649)\n\nIt was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the CD-ROM driver of\nthe Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation (kernel memory). (CVE-2018-16658)\n\nIt was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the HID Bluetooth\nimplementation in the Linux kernel that could lead to a buffer overwrite.\nAn attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-9363)\n",
