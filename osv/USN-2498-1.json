  "details": "It was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly sent old keys in response to a\n-randkey -keepold request. An authenticated remote attacker could use this\nissue to forge tickets by leveraging administrative access. This issue\nonly affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\n(CVE-2014-5351)\n\nIt was discovered that the libgssapi_krb5 library incorrectly processed\nsecurity context handles. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause\na denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-5352)\n\nPatrik Kis discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled LDAP queries with\nno results. An authenticated remote attacker could use this issue to cause\nthe KDC to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2014-5353)\n\nIt was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled creating database\nentries for a keyless principal when using LDAP. An authenticated remote\nattacker could use this issue to cause the KDC to crash, resulting in a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2014-5354)\n\nIt was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled memory when processing\nXDR data. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause kadmind to crash,\nresulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2014-9421)\n\nIt was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled two-component server\nprincipals. A remote attacker could use this issue to perform impersonation\nattacks. (CVE-2014-9422)\n\nIt was discovered that the libgssrpc library leaked uninitialized bytes. A\nremote attacker could use this issue to possibly obtain sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2014-9423)\n",
