  "details": "Pieter Wuille discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled Bignum squaring.\n(CVE-2014-3570)\n\nMarkus Stenberg discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain crafted\nDTLS messages. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3571)\n\nKarthikeyan Bhargavan discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain\nhandshakes. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to downgrade to\nECDH, removing forward secrecy from the ciphersuite. (CVE-2014-3572)\n\nAntti Karjalainen, Tuomo Untinen and Konrad Kraszewski discovered that\nOpenSSL incorrectly handled certain certificate fingerprints. A remote\nattacker could possibly use this issue to trick certain applications that\nrely on the uniqueness of fingerprints. (CVE-2014-8275)\n\nKarthikeyan Bhargavan discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain\nkey exchanges. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to downgrade\nthe security of the session to EXPORT_RSA. (CVE-2015-0204)\n\nKarthikeyan Bhargavan discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled client\nauthentication. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to\nauthenticate without the use of a private key in certain limited scenarios.\nThis issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.10. (CVE-2015-0205)\n\nChris Mueller discovered that OpenSSL incorrect handled memory when\nprocessing DTLS records. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause\nOpenSSL to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service. This issue\nonly affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.10.\n(CVE-2015-0206)\n",
