  "details": "It was discovered that the Intel Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate certain Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS). A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(Wi-Fi disconnect). (CVE-2019-0136)\n\nIt was discovered that the Bluetooth UART implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly check for missing tty operations. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-10207)\n\nIt was discovered that the GTCO tablet input driver in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly bounds check the initial HID report sent by the device. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-13631)\n\nIt was discovered that an out-of-bounds read existed in the QLogic QEDI\niSCSI Initiator Driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly\nuse this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-15090)\n\nHui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB audio driver for the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate device meta data. A physically\nproximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2019-15117)\n\nHui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB audio driver for the\nLinux kernel improperly performed recursion while handling device meta\ndata. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2019-15118)\n\nIt was discovered that the Raremono AM/FM/SW radio device driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly allocate memory, leading to a use-after-free.\nA physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-15211)\n\nIt was discovered at a double-free error existed in the USB Rio 500 device\ndriver for the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-15212)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the CPiA2 video4linux\ndevice driver for the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-15215)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Softmac USB Prism54\ndevice driver in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15220)\n\nBenjamin Moody discovered that the XFS file system in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle an error condition when out of disk quota. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2019-15538)\n\nIt was discovered that the Hisilicon HNS3 ethernet device driver in the\nLinux kernel contained an out of bounds access vulnerability. A local\nattacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2019-15925)\n\nIt was discovered that the Atheros mobile chipset driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate data in some situations. An attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15926)\n\nDaniele Antonioli, Nils Ole Tippenhauer, and Kasper B. Rasmussen discovered\nthat the Bluetooth protocol BR/EDR specification did not properly require\nsufficiently strong encryption key lengths. A physically proximate attacker\ncould use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-9506)\n\nIt was discovered that ZR364XX Camera USB device driver for the Linux\nkernel did not properly initialize memory. A physically proximate attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2019-15217)\n\nIt was discovered that the Siano USB MDTV receiver device driver in the\nLinux kernel made improper assumptions about the device characteristics. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2019-15218)\n\nIt was discovered that the Line 6 POD USB device driver in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate data size information from the device. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2019-15221)\n\nIt was discovered that the Line 6 USB driver for the Linux kernel contained\na race condition when the device was disconnected. A physically proximate\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2019-15223)\n",
