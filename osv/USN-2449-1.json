  "details": "Neel Mehta discovered that NTP generated weak authentication keys. A remote\nattacker could possibly use this issue to brute force the authentication\nkey and send requests if permitted by IP restrictions. (CVE-2014-9293)\n\nStephen Roettger discovered that NTP generated weak MD5 keys. A remote\nattacker could possibly use this issue to brute force the MD5 key and spoof\na client or server. (CVE-2014-9294)\n\nStephen Roettger discovered that NTP contained buffer overflows in the\ncrypto_recv(), ctl_putdata() and configure() functions. In non-default\nconfigurations, a remote attacker could use these issues to cause NTP to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. The default compiler options for affected releases should reduce the\nvulnerability to a denial of service. In addition, attackers would be\nisolated by the NTP AppArmor profile. (CVE-2014-9295)\n\nStephen Roettger discovered that NTP incorrectly continued processing when\nhandling certain errors. (CVE-2014-9296)\n",
