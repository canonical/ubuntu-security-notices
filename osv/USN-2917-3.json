  "details": "USN-2917-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. This update caused several\nweb compatibility regressions.\n\nThis update fixes the problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Francis Gabriel discovered a buffer overflow during ASN.1 decoding in NSS.\n If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an\n attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via\n application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\n user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2016-1950)\n \n Bob Clary, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, Daniel\n Holbert, Jesse Ruderman, Randell Jesup, Carsten Book, Gian-Carlo Pascutto,\n Tyson Smith, Andrea Marchesini, and Jukka Jyl\u00e4nki discovered multiple\n memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a\n specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to\n cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code\n with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2016-1952,\n CVE-2016-1953)\n \n Nicolas Golubovic discovered that CSP violation reports can be used to\n overwrite local files. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially\n crafted website with addon signing disabled and unpacked addons installed,\n an attacker could potentially exploit this to gain additional privileges.\n (CVE-2016-1954)\n \n Muneaki Nishimura discovered that CSP violation reports contained full\n paths for cross-origin iframe navigations. An attacker could potentially\n exploit this to steal confidential data. (CVE-2016-1955)\n \n Ucha Gobejishvili discovered that performing certain WebGL operations\n resulted in memory resource exhaustion with some Intel GPUs, requiring\n a reboot. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\n website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial\n of service. (CVE-2016-1956)\n \n Jose Martinez and Romina Santillan discovered a memory leak in\n libstagefright during MPEG4 video file processing in some circumstances.\n If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an\n attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via\n memory exhaustion. (CVE-2016-1957)\n \n Abdulrahman Alqabandi discovered that the addressbar could be blank or\n filled with page defined content in some circumstances. If a user were\n tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\n potentially exploit this to conduct URL spoofing attacks. (CVE-2016-1958)\n \n Looben Yang discovered an out-of-bounds read in Service Worker Manager. If\n a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker\n could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via\n application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\n user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2016-1959)\n \n A use-after-free was discovered in the HTML5 string parser. If a user were\n tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\n potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application\n crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking\n Firefox. (CVE-2016-1960)\n \n A use-after-free was discovered in the SetBody function of HTMLDocument.\n If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an\n attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via\n application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\n user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2016-1961)\n \n Dominique Haza\u00ebl-Massieux discovered a use-after-free when using multiple\n WebRTC data channels. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially\n crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a\n denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with\n the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2016-1962)\n \n It was discovered that Firefox crashes when local files are modified\n whilst being read by the FileReader API. If a user were tricked in to\n opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\n this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking\n Firefox. (CVE-2016-1963)\n \n Nicolas Gr\u00e9goire discovered a use-after-free during XML transformations.\n If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an\n attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via\n application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\n user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2016-1964)\n \n Tsubasa Iinuma discovered a mechanism to cause the addressbar to display\n an incorrect URL, using history navigations and the Location protocol\n property. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\n website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct URL\n spoofing attacks. (CVE-2016-1965)\n \n A memory corruption issues was discovered in the NPAPI subsystem. If\n a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website with a\n malicious plugin installed, an attacker could potentially exploit this\n to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary\n code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2016-1966)\n \n Jordi Chancel discovered a same-origin-policy bypass when using\n performance.getEntries and history navigation with session restore. If\n a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker\n could potentially exploit this to steal confidential data. (CVE-2016-1967)\n \n Luke Li discovered a buffer overflow during Brotli decompression in some\n circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\n website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of\n service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the\n privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2016-1968)\n \n Ronald Crane discovered a use-after-free in GetStaticInstance in WebRTC.\n If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an\n attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via\n application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\n user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2016-1973)\n \n Ronald Crane discovered an out-of-bounds read following a failed\n allocation in the HTML parser in some circumstances. If a user were\n tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\n potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application\n crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking\n Firefox. (CVE-2016-1974)\n \n Holger Fuhrmannek, Tyson Smith and Holger Fuhrmannek reported multiple\n memory safety issues in the Graphite 2 library. If a user were tricked in\n to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\n exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or\n execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.\n (CVE-2016-1977, CVE-2016-2790, CVE-2016-2791, CVE-2016-2792,\n CVE-2016-2793, CVE-2016-2794, CVE-2016-2795, CVE-2016-2796, CVE-2016-2797,\n CVE-2016-2798, CVE-2016-2799, CVE-2016-2800, CVE-2016-2801, CVE-2016-2802)\n",
