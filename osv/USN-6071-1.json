  "id": "USN-6071-1",
  "summary": "linux-oem-5.17 vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the Traffic-Control Index (TCINDEX) implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not properly perform filter deactivation in some\nsituations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated\nprivileges. Please note that with the fix for this CVE, kernel support for\nthe TCINDEX classifier has been removed. (CVE-2023-1829)\n\nLin Ma discovered a race condition in the io_uring subsystem in the Linux\nkernel, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-0468)\n\nIt was discovered that the OverlayFS implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle copy up operation in some conditions. A local attacker\ncould possibly use this to gain elevated privileges. (CVE-2023-0386)\n\nDavid Hildenbrand discovered that a race condition existed in the memory\nmanager of the Linux kernel when handling copy-on-write with shared memory\npages. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2590)\n\nIt was discovered that the sound subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a\nrace condition in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause\na denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3303)\n\nGwnaun Jung discovered that the SFB packet scheduling implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3586)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the EFI capsule loader\ndriver in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-40307)\n\nZheng Wang and Zhuorao Yang discovered that the RealTek RTL8712U wireless\ndriver in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-4095)\n\nIt was discovered that the USB core subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle nested reset events. A local attacker with physical access\ncould plug in a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service\n(kernel deadlock). (CVE-2022-4662)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Xen transport layer\nimplementation for the 9P file system protocol in the Linux kernel, leading\nto a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause\na denial of service (guest crash) or expose sensitive information (guest\nkernel memory). (CVE-2023-1859)\n\nKyle Zeng discovered that the ATM VC queuing discipline implementation in\nthe Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some\nsituations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2023-23455)\n\nLianhui Tang discovered that the MPLS implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly handle certain sysctl allocation failure conditions,\nleading to a double-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause\na denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-26545)\n\n",
