  "details": "Kiyin (\u5c39\u4eae) discovered that the NFC LLCP protocol implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a reference counting error. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-25670)\n\nKiyin (\u5c39\u4eae) discovered that the NFC LLCP protocol implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error\nsituations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(memory exhaustion). (CVE-2020-25671, CVE-2020-25672)\n\nKiyin (\u5c39\u4eae) discovered that the NFC LLCP protocol implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle error conditions in some situations,\nleading to an infinite loop. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2020-25673)\n\nIt was discovered that the Realtek RTL8188EU Wireless device driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate ssid lengths in some situations. An\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2021-28660)\n\nZygo Blaxell discovered that the btrfs file system implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a race condition during certain cloning operations.\nA local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2021-28964)\n\nVince Weaver discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle certain PEBS records properly for some Intel Haswell\nprocessors. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2021-28971)\n\nIt was discovered that the RPA PCI Hotplug driver implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle device name writes via sysfs, leading\nto a buffer overflow. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2021-28972)\n\nIt was discovered that the Qualcomm IPC router implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly initialize memory passed to user space. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2021-29647)\n\nDan Carpenter discovered that the block device manager (dm) implementation\nin the Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow in the ioctl for listing\ndevices. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2021-31916)\n\nIt was discovered that the CIPSO implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to use-\nafter-free vulnerabilities. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-33033)\n\nWolfgang Frisch discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained an integer overflow when handling metadata inode\nextents. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 file\nsystem image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2021-3428)\n\n\u9a6c\u54f2\u5b87 discovered that the IEEE 1394 (Firewire) nosy packet sniffer driver in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some\nsituations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3483)\n",
