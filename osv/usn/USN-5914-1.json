  "summary": "linux-oem-6.0 vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the Upper Level Protocol (ULP) subsystem in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle sockets entering the LISTEN state in\ncertain protocols, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-0461)\n\nIt was discovered that the NFSD implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle some RPC messages, leading to a buffer overflow. A remote\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-43945)\n\nTam\u00e1s Koczka discovered that the Bluetooth L2CAP handshake implementation\nin the Linux kernel contained multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-42896)\n\nIt was discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel\ncontained a data race condition. An attacker could possibly use this to\ncause undesired behaviors. (CVE-2022-3567)\n\nIt was discovered that the NFSD implementation in the Linux kernel\ncontained a use-after-free vulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2022-4379)\n\nIt was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the\nBluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2022-45934)\n\nIt was discovered that the Atmel WILC1000 driver in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly validate offsets, leading to an out-of-bounds read\nvulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2022-47520)\n\nJos\u00e9 Oliveira and Rodrigo Branco discovered that the prctl syscall\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not properly protect against\nindirect branch prediction attacks in some situations. A local attacker\ncould possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-0045)\n\nIt was discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel contained\na use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-0469)\n\n",
