  "details": "USN-3239-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the GNU C Library. Unfortunately,\nthe fix for CVE-2015-5180 introduced an internal ABI change within\nthe resolver library. This update reverts the change. We apologize\nfor the inconvenience.\n\nPlease note that long-running services that were restarted to compensate\nfor the USN-3239-1 update may need to be restarted again.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled the\n strxfrm() function. An attacker could use this issue to cause a denial\n of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected\n Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2015-8982)\n \n It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the\n _IO_wstr_overflow() function of the GNU C Library. An attacker could\n use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary\n code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04\n LTS. (CVE-2015-8983)\n \n It was discovered that the fnmatch() function in the GNU C Library\n did not properly handle certain malformed patterns. An attacker could\n use this to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu\n 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2015-8984)\n \n Alexander Cherepanov discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the\n glob implementation of the GNU C Library. An attacker could use this\n to specially craft a directory layout and cause a denial of service.\n (CVE-2016-1234)\n \n Florian Weimer discovered a NULL pointer dereference in the DNS\n resolver of the GNU C Library. An attacker could use this to cause\n a denial of service. (CVE-2015-5180)\n \n Michael Petlan discovered an unbounded stack allocation in the\n getaddrinfo() function of the GNU C Library. An attacker could use\n this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-3706)\n \n Aldy Hernandez discovered an unbounded stack allocation in the sunrpc\n implementation in the GNU C Library. An attacker could use this to\n cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-4429)\n \n Tim Ruehsen discovered that the getaddrinfo() implementation in the\n GNU C Library did not properly track memory allocations. An attacker\n could use this to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected\n Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2016-5417)\n \n Andreas Schwab discovered that the GNU C Library on ARM 32-bit\n platforms did not properly set up execution contexts. An attacker\n could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-6323)\n",
