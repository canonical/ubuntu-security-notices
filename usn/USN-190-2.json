It was\ndiscovered that the same problem also affects the ucs-snmp\nimplementation (which is used by the Cyrus email server).\n\nOriginal advisory:\n\n  A remote Denial of Service has been discovered in the SMNP (Simple\n  Network Management Protocol) library. If a SNMP agent uses TCP sockets\n  for communication, a malicious SNMP server could exploit this to crash\n  the agent. Please note that by default SNMP uses UDP sockets.",
