                "description": "Patryk Sondej and Piotr Krysiuk discovered that a race condition existed in the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel when processing batch requests, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-32233)  Gwangun Jung discovered that the Quick Fair Queueing scheduler implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-31436)  Reima Ishii discovered that the nested KVM implementation for Intel x86 processors in the Linux kernel did not properly validate control registers in certain situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (guest crash). (CVE-2023-30456)  It was discovered that the Broadcom FullMAC USB WiFi driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform data buffer size validation in some situations. A physically proximate attacker could use this to craft a malicious USB device that when inserted, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-1380)  Jean-Baptiste Cayrou discovered that the shiftfs file system in the Ubuntu Linux kernel contained a race condition when handling inode locking in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). (CVE-2023-2612)",
