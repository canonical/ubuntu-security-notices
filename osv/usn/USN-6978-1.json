  "details": "It was discovered that XStream incorrectly handled parsing of certain\ncrafted XML documents. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to\nread arbitrary files. (CVE-2016-3674)\n\nZhihong Tian and Hui Lu found that XStream was vulnerable to remote code\nexecution. A remote attacker could run arbitrary shell commands by\nmanipulating the processed input stream. (CVE-2020-26217)\n\nIt was discovered that XStream was vulnerable to server-side forgery\nattacks. A remote attacker could request data from internal resources\nthat are not publicly available only by manipulating the processed input\nstream. (CVE-2020-26258)\n\nIt was discovered that XStream was vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion\non the local host. A remote attacker could use this to delete arbitrary\nknown files on the host as long as the executing process had sufficient\nrights only by manipulating the processed input stream. (CVE-2020-26259)\n\nIt was discovered that XStream was vulnerable to denial of service,\narbitrary code execution, arbitrary file deletion and server-side forgery\nattacks. A remote attacker could cause any of those issues by\nmanipulating the processed input stream.
