  "details": "It was discovered that Message ID calculation was based on uninitialized\ndata. An attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2020-6792)\n\nMutiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, obtain sensitive\ninformation, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-6793, CVE-2020-6795,\nCVE-2020-6822)\n\nIt was discovered that if a user saved passwords before Thunderbird 60\nand then later set a master password, an unencrypted copy of these\npasswords would still be accessible. A local user could exploit this to\nobtain sensitive information. (CVE-2020-6794)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context,\nan attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service,\nconduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, obtain sensitive information,\nor execute arbitrary code.

If a user were tricked in to using\nthe \u2018Copy as cURL\u2019 feature to copy and paste a command with specially\ncrafted data in to a terminal, an attacker could potentially exploit this\nto execute arbitrary commands via command injection.
