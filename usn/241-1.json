  "description": "The \"mod_imap\" module (which provides support for image maps) did not\nproperly escape the \"referer\" URL which rendered it vulnerable against\na cross-site scripting attack. A malicious web page (or HTML email)\ncould trick a user into visiting a site running the vulnerable mod_imap,\nand employ cross-site-scripting techniques to gather sensitive user\ninformation from that site. (CVE-2005-3352)\n\nHartmut Keil discovered a Denial of Service vulnerability in the SSL\nmodule (\"mod_ssl\") that affects SSL-enabled virtual hosts with a\ncustomized error page for error 400. By sending a specially crafted\nrequest to the server, a remote attacker could crash the server. This\nonly affects Apache 2, and only if the \"worker\" implementation\n(apache2-mpm-worker) is used.
