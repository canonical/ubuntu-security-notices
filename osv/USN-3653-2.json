  "details": "USN-3653-1 fixed vulnerabilities and added mitigations in the Linux\nkernel for Ubuntu 17.10. This update provides the corresponding\nupdates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu\n17.10 for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.\n\nJann Horn and Ken Johnson discovered that microprocessors utilizing\nspeculative execution of a memory read may allow unauthorized memory\nreads via a sidechannel attack. This flaw is known as Spectre\nVariant 4. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation, including kernel memory. (CVE-2018-3639)\n\nIt was discovered that the netlink subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly restrict observations of netlink messages to the appropriate net\nnamespace. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information\n(kernel netlink traffic). (CVE-2017-17449)\n\nTuba Yavuz discovered that a double-free error existed in the USBTV007\ndriver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2017-17975)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Device Mapper\ncomponent of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-18203)\n\nIt was discovered that an infinite loop could occur in the madvise(2)\nimplementation in the Linux kernel in certain circumstances. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system hang).\n(CVE-2017-18208)\n\nSilvio Cesare discovered a buffer overwrite existed in the NCPFS\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker controlling a\nmalicious NCPFS server could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-8822)\n",
