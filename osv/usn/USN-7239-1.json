  "details": "It was discovered that libmicrodns could recursively follow the same\ncompression pointer, leading to an infinite loop. An attacker could\npossibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-6071)\n\nIt was discovered that libmicrodns did not check the return value of the\nrr_decode function, which could lead to a double free. An attacker could\npossibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-6072)\n\nIt was discovered that libmicrodns incorrectly handled certain inputs,\nwhich could lead to an integer overflow. An attacker could possibly use\nthis issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-6073)\n\nIt was discovered that libmicrodns incorrectly handled certain inputs,\nwhich could lead to a out-of-bounds read. An attacker could possibly use\nthis issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-6077)\n\nIt was discovered that libmicrodns incorrectly handled memory when parsing\nmDNS messages in mdns_recv, which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference.\nAn attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2020-6078)\n\nIt was discovered that libmicrodns incorrectly handled memory, which could\nlead to excessive memory consumption due to memory leaks. An attacker\ncould possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2020-6079, CVE-2020-6080)\n",
