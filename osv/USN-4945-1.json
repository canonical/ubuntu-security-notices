  "details": "It was discovered that the Nouveau GPU driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle error conditions in some situations. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-25639)\n\nJan Beulich discovered that the Xen netback backend in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle certain error conditions under paravirtualization. An\nattacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service\n(host domain crash). (CVE-2021-28038)\n\nIt was discovered that the fastrpc driver in the Linux kernel did not\nprevent user space applications from sending kernel RPC messages. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges.\n(CVE-2021-28375)\n\nIt was discovered that the Realtek RTL8188EU Wireless device driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate ssid lengths in some situations. An\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2021-28660)\n\nIt was discovered that the USB/IP driver in the Linux kernel contained race\nconditions during the update of local and shared status. An attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-29265)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the netfilter subsystem\nof the Linux kernel when replacing tables. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-29650)\n\nArnd Bergmann discovered that the video4linux subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2021-30002)\n",
