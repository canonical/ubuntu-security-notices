  "details": "Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not\ncorrectly perform validation when handling IPT_SO_SET_REPLACE events. A\nlocal unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative\nprivileges. (CVE-2016-3134)\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly enforce rlimits\nfor file descriptors sent over UNIX domain sockets. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2013-4312)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed when handling heartbeat-\ntimeout events in the SCTP implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2015-8767)\n\nAndy Lutomirski discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel's\ntranslation lookaside buffer (TLB) handling of flush events. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly leak\nsensitive information. (CVE-2016-2069)\n\nAndrey Konovalov discovered that the ALSA USB MIDI driver incorrectly\nperformed a double-free. A local attacker with physical access could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code with administrative privileges. (CVE-2016-2384)\n\nDmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)\nframework did not verify that a FIFO was attached to a client before\nattempting to clear it. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash). (CVE-2016-2543)\n\nDmitry Vyukov discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced\nLinux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework between timer setup and closing\nof the client, resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-2544)\n\nDmitry Vyukov discovered a race condition in the timer handling\nimplementation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework,\nresulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-2545)\n\nDmitry Vyukov discovered race conditions in the Advanced Linux Sound\nArchitecture (ALSA) framework's timer ioctls leading to a use-after-free. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2546)\n\nDmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)\nframework's handling of high resolution timers did not properly manage its\ndata structures. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system hang or crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2016-2547, CVE-2016-2548)\n\nDmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)\nframework's handling of high resolution timers could lead to a deadlock\ncondition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system hang). (CVE-2016-2549)\n",
