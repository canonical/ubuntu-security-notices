  "details": "USN-3469-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04\nLTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux\nHardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu\n14.04 LTS.\n\nAnthony Perard discovered that the Xen virtual block driver did not\nproperly initialize some data structures before passing them to user space.\nA local attacker in a guest VM could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation from the host OS or other guest VMs. (CVE-2017-10911)\n\nBo Zhang discovered that the netlink wireless configuration interface in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly validate attributes when handling certain\nrequests. A local attacker with the CAP_NET_ADMIN could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-12153)\n\nIt was discovered that the nested KVM implementation in the Linux\nkernel in some situations did not properly prevent second level guests\nfrom reading and writing the hardware CR8 register. A local attacker\nin a guest could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n\nIt was discovered that the key management subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly restrict key reads on negatively instantiated keys. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2017-12192)\n\nIt was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the sysfs interface\nfor the QLogic 24xx+ series SCSI driver in the Linux kernel. A local\nprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2017-14051)\n\nIt was discovered that the ATI Radeon framebuffer driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly initialize a data structure returned to user space.\nA local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel\nmemory). (CVE-2017-14156)\n\nDave Chinner discovered that the XFS filesystem did not enforce that the\nrealtime inode flag was settable only on filesystems on a realtime device.\nA local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2017-14340)\n\nChunYu Wang discovered that the iSCSI transport implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate data structures. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-14489)\n\nIt was discovered that the generic SCSI driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly initialize data returned to user space in some situations. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2017-14991)\n\nDmitry Vyukov discovered that the Floating Point Unit (fpu) subsystem in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly handle attempts to set reserved bits in a\ntask's extended state (xstate) area. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-15537)\n\nPengfei Wang discovered that the Turtle Beach MultiSound audio device\ndriver in the Linux kernel contained race conditions when fetching\nfrom the ring-buffer. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (infinite loop). (CVE-2017-9984, CVE-2017-9985)\n",
