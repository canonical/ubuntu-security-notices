  "description": "Richard Harms discovered that cpio did not sufficiently validate file\nproperties when creating archives. Files with e. g. a very large size\ncaused a buffer overflow. By tricking a user or an automatic backup\nsystem into putting a specially crafted file into a cpio archive, a\nlocal attacker could probably exploit this to execute arbitrary code\nwith the privileges of the target user (which is likely root in an\nautomatic backup system).",
