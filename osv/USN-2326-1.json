  "details": "A use-after-free was discovered in the SVG implementation in Blink. If a\nuser were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker\ncould potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer\ncrash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed\nrender process. (CVE-2014-3168)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in the DOM implementation in Blink. If a\nuser were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker\ncould potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer\ncrash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed\nrender process. (CVE-2014-3169)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2014-3171)\n\nIt was discovered that WebGL clear calls did not interact properly with\nthe state of a draw buffer. If a user were tricked in to opening a\nspecially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\ncause a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3173)\n\nA threading issue was discovered in the Web Audio API during attempts to\nupdate biquad filter coefficients. If a user were tricked in to opening a\nspecially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\ncause a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3174)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of\nservice via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user invoking the program.
