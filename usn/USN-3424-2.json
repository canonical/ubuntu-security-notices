  "description": "USN-3424-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in libxml2. This update\nprovides the corresponding update for Ubuntu 12.04 ESM.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that a type confusion error existed in libxml2. An\n attacker could use this to specially construct XML data that\n could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary\n code. (CVE-2017-0663)\n\n It was discovered that libxml2 did not properly validate parsed entity\n references. An attacker could use this to specially construct XML\n data that could expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-7375)\n\n It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in libxml2 when\n handling HTTP redirects. An attacker could use this to specially\n construct XML data that could cause a denial of service or possibly\n execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-7376)\n\n Marcel B\u00f6hme and Van-Thuan Pham discovered a buffer overflow in\n libxml2 when handling elements. An attacker could use this to specially\n construct XML data that could cause a denial of service or possibly\n execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-9047)\n\n Marcel B\u00f6hme and Van-Thuan Pham discovered a buffer overread\n in libxml2 when handling elements. An attacker could use this\n to specially construct XML data that could cause a denial of\n service. (CVE-2017-9048)\n\n Marcel B\u00f6hme and Van-Thuan Pham discovered multiple buffer overreads\n in libxml2 when handling parameter-entity references. An attacker\n could use these to specially construct XML data that could cause a\n denial of service. (CVE-2017-9049, CVE-2017-9050)\n",
