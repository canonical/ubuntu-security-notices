  "description": "Thomas Wolff and Miloslav Trmac discovered a race condition in the\nfetchmailconf program. The output configuration file was initially\ncreated with insecure permissions, and secure permissions were applied\nafter writing the configuration into the file. During this time, the\nfile was world readable on a standard system (unless the user manually\ntightened his umask setting), which could expose email passwords to\nlocal users.",
