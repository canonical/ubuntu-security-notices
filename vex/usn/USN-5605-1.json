A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2021-33061)  It was discovered that the virtual terminal driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle VGA console font changes, leading to an out-of-bounds write. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-33656)",
