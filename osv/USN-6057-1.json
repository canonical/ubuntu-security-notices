  "summary": "linux-intel-iotg vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the Traffic-Control Index (TCINDEX) implementation\nin the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-1281)\n\nIt was discovered that the OverlayFS implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle copy up operation in some conditions. A local attacker\ncould possibly use this to gain elevated privileges. (CVE-2023-0386)\n\nHaowei Yan discovered that a race condition existed in the Layer 2\nTunneling Protocol (L2TP) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2022-4129)\n\nIt was discovered that the network queuing discipline implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a null pointer dereference in some situations. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2022-47929)\n\nIt was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel contained a null pointer dereference in some situations. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2022-4842)\n\nKyle Zeng discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel\ncontained a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in certain situations. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-0394)\n\nIt was discovered that the Human Interface Device (HID) support driver in\nthe Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some\nsituations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2023-1073)\n\nIt was discovered that a memory leak existed in the SCTP protocol\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2023-1074)\n\nIt was discovered that the NFS implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle pending tasks in some situations. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive\ninformation (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-1652)\n\nLianhui Tang discovered that the MPLS implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly handle certain sysctl allocation failure conditions,\nleading to a double-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause\na denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-26545)\n\n",
