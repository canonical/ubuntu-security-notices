  "details": "Florian Weimer discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled\ncertain memory operations. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause\nthe GNU C Library to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.\n(CVE-2017-12133)\n\nIt was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled certain\nSSE2-optimized memmove operations. A remote attacker could use this issue\nto cause the GNU C Library to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.\n(CVE-2017-18269)\n\nIt was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled certain\npathname operations. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the\nGNU C Library to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.\n(CVE-2018-11236)\n\nIt was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled certain\nAVX-512-optimized mempcpy operations. A remote attacker could use this\nissue to cause the GNU C Library to crash, resulting in a denial of\nservice, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected\nUbuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2018-11237)\n\nIt was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled certain\nhostname loookups. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the GNU\nC Library to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute\narbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2018-19591)\n\nJakub Wilk discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled certain\nmemalign functions. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the GNU\nC Library to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute\narbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2018-6485)\n\nIt was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly ignored the\nLD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC environment variable after security transitions. A\nlocal attacker could use this issue to bypass ASLR restrictions.\n(CVE-2019-19126)\n\nIt was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled certain\nregular expressions. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to\ncause the GNU C Library to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This\nissue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2019-9169)\n\nIt was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled certain\nbit patterns. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the GNU C\nLibrary to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute\narbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04\nLTS. (CVE-2020-10029)\n\nIt was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled certain\nsignal trampolines on PowerPC. A remote attacker could use this issue to\ncause the GNU C Library to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-1751)\n\nIt was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled tilde\nexpansion. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the GNU C\nLibrary to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2020-1752)\n",
