  "details": "M\u00e1t\u00e9 Kukri discovered that the acpi command in GRUB 2 allowed privileged\nusers to load crafted ACPI tables when secure boot is enabled. An attacker\ncould use this to bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. (CVE-2020-14372)\n\nChris Coulson discovered that the rmmod command in GRUB 2 contained a use-\nafter-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to execute\narbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. (CVE-2020-25632)\n\nChris Coulson discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the command line\nparser in GRUB 2. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code\nand bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. (CVE-2020-27749)\n\nIt was discovered that the cutmem command in GRUB 2 did not honor secure\nboot locking. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code and\nbypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. (CVE-2020-27779)\n\nIt was discovered that the option parser in GRUB 2 contained a heap\noverflow vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to execute\narbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. (CVE-2021-20225)\n\nIt was discovered that the menu rendering implementation in GRUB 2 did not\nproperly calculate the amount of memory needed in some situations, leading\nto out-of-bounds writes. A local attacker could use this to execute\narbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. (CVE-2021-20233)\n",
