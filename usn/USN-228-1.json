  "description": "Stefan Esser discovered several buffer overflows in the handling of\nURLs. By attempting to load an URL with a specially crafted invalid\nhostname, a local attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the application that uses the cURL\nlibrary.\n\nIt is not possible to trick cURL into loading a malicious URL with an\nHTTP redirect, so this vulnerability was usually not exploitable\nremotely. However, it could be exploited locally to e. g. circumvent\nPHP security restrictions.",
