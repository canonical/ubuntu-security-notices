  "details": "\nSeth Jenkins discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly perform\naddress randomization for a per-cpu memory management structure. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory) or\nin conjunction with another kernel vulnerability. (CVE-2023-0597)\n\nYu Hao and Weiteng Chen discovered that the Bluetooth HCI UART driver in\nthe Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a null pointer\ndereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-31083)\n\nLin Ma discovered that the Netlink Transformation (XFRM) subsystem in the\nLinux kernel contained a null pointer dereference vulnerability in some\nsituations. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2023-3772)\n\nIt was discovered that the Siano USB MDTV receiver device driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle device initialization failures in\ncertain situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A physically\nproximate attacker could use this cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-4132)\n",
