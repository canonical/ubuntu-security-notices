  "description": "USN-3583-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 14.04\nLTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux\nHardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for Ubuntu\n12.04 ESM.\n\nIt was discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the\nFlash-Friendly File System (f2fs) in the Linux kernel. An attacker could\nconstruct a malicious file system that, when mounted, could cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2017-0750)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability existed in the ALSA PCM subsystem of the Linux kernel. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-0861)\n\nIt was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel allowed\npassthrough of the diagnostic I/O port 0x80. An attacker in a guest VM\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS.\n(CVE-2017-1000407)\n\nBo Zhang discovered that the netlink wireless configuration interface in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly validate attributes when handling certain\nrequests. A local attacker with the CAP_NET_ADMIN could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-12153)\n\nVitaly Mayatskikh discovered that the SCSI subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly track reference counts when merging buffers. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2017-12190)\n\nIt was discovered that the key management subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly restrict key reads on negatively instantiated keys. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2017-12192)\n\nIt was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the sysfs interface\nfor the QLogic 24xx+ series SCSI driver in the Linux kernel. A local\nprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2017-14051)\n\nOtto Ebeling discovered that the memory manager in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly check the effective UID in some situations. A local attacker could\nuse this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-14140)\n\nIt was discovered that the ATI Radeon framebuffer driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly initialize a data structure returned to user space.\nA local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel\nmemory). (CVE-2017-14156)\n\nChunYu Wang discovered that the iSCSI transport implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate data structures. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-14489)\n\nJames Patrick-Evans discovered a race condition in the LEGO USB Infrared\nTower driver in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2017-15102)\n\nChunYu Wang discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the\nSCTP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code, (CVE-2017-15115)\n\nIt was discovered that the key management subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle NULL payloads with non-zero length values. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2017-15274)\n\nIt was discovered that the Bluebooth Network Encapsulation Protocol (BNEP)\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not validate the type of socket\npassed in the BNEPCONNADD ioctl(). A local attacker with the CAP_NET_ADMIN\nprivilege could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-15868)\n\nAndrey Konovalov discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the USB\nserial console driver in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-16525)\n\nIt was discovered that the netfilter passive OS fingerprinting (xt_osf)\nmodule did not properly perform access control checks. A local attacker\ncould improperly modify the systemwide OS fingerprint list.\n(CVE-2017-17450)\n\nIt was discovered that the HMAC implementation did not validate the state\nof the underlying cryptographic hash algorithm. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2017-17806)\n\nDenys Fedoryshchenko discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the\nnetfilter xt_TCPMSS filter of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-18017)\n\nGareth Evans discovered that the shm IPC subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly restrict mapping page zero. A local privileged attacker could\nuse this to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-5669)\n\nIt was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existing in the\nIPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (infinite loop). (CVE-2017-7542)\n\nTommi Rantala and Brad Spengler discovered that the memory manager in the\nLinux kernel did not properly enforce the CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM protection\nmechanism. A local attacker with access to /dev/mem could use this to\nexpose sensitive information or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2017-7889)\n\nMohamed Ghannam discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the DCCP\nprotocol implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2017-8824)\n\nMohamed Ghannam discovered a null pointer dereference in the RDS (Reliable\nDatagram Sockets) protocol implementation of the Linux kernel. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2018-5333)\n\n\u8303\u9f99\u98de discovered that a race condition existed in loop block device\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2018-5344)\n",
