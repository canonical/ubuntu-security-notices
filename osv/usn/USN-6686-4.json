  "details": "It was discovered that the DesignWare USB3 for Qualcomm SoCs driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions during device\nregistration. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2023-22995)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Cypress touchscreen\ndriver in the Linux kernel during device removal, leading to a use-after-\nfree vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause\na denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-4134)\n\n\u9ec4\u601d\u806a discovered that the NFC Controller Interface (NCI) implementation in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly handle certain memory allocation failure\nconditions, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-46343)\n\nIt was discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel contained\na race condition, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-46862)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Bluetooth subsystem\nof the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-51779)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Rose X.25 protocol\nimplementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after- free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-51782)\n\nAlon Zahavi discovered that the NVMe-oF/TCP subsystem of the Linux kernel\ndid not properly handle connect command payloads in certain situations,\nleading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could use\nthis to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-6121)\n\nIt was discovered that the VirtIO subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly initialize memory in some situations. A local attacker could use\nthis to possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2024-0340)\n\nDan Carpenter discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not store data in properly sized memory locations. A local user could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2024-0607)\n",
