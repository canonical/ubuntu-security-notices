A local attacker could\npossibly use this issue to bypass configured restrictions and execute\narbitrary commands. (CVE-2016-7076)\n\nIt was discovered that Sudo did not properly parse the contents of\n/proc/[pid]/stat when attempting to determine its controlling tty. A local\nattacker in some configurations could possibly use this to overwrite any\nfile on the filesystem, bypassing intended permissions. (CVE-2017-1000368)\n",
