  "details": "USN-2935-1 fixed vulnerabilities in PAM. The updates contained a packaging\nchange that prevented upgrades in certain multiarch environments. This\nupdate fixes the problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that the PAM pam_userdb module incorrectly used a\n case-insensitive method when comparing hashed passwords. A local attacker\n could possibly use this issue to make brute force attacks easier. This\n issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2013-7041)\n \n Sebastian Krahmer discovered that the PAM pam_timestamp module incorrectly\n performed filtering. A local attacker could use this issue to create\n arbitrary files, or possibly bypass authentication. This issue only\n affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2014-2583)\n \n Sebastien Macke discovered that the PAM pam_unix module incorrectly handled\n large passwords. A local attacker could possibly use this issue in certain\n environments to enumerate usernames or cause a denial of service.\n (CVE-2015-3238)\n",
