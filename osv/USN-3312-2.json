  "details": "USN-3312-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04\nLTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux\nHardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu\n14.04 LTS.\n\nIt was discovered that the netfilter netlink implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate batch messages. A local attacker with the\nCAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to expose sensitive information or\ncause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-7917)\n\nQian Zhang discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the tipc_msg_build()\nfunction in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with\nadministrative privileges. (CVE-2016-8632)\n\nIt was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel in\nsome situations did not prevent special internal keyrings from being joined\nby userspace keyrings. A privileged local attacker could use this to bypass\nmodule verification. (CVE-2016-9604)\n\nIt was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the trace subsystem in\nthe Linux kernel. A privileged local attacker could use this to execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2017-0605)\n\nDmitry Vyukov discovered that KVM implementation in the Linux kernel\nimproperly emulated the VMXON instruction. A local attacker in a guest OS\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) in the\nhost OS. (CVE-2017-2596)\n\nDaniel Jiang discovered that a race condition existed in the ipv4 ping\nsocket implementation in the Linux kernel. A local privileged attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-2671)\n\nDi Shen discovered that a race condition existed in the perf subsystem of\nthe Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice or possibly gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2017-6001)\n\nEric Biggers discovered a memory leak in the keyring implementation in the\nLinux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(memory consumption). (CVE-2017-7472)\n\nSabrina Dubroca discovered that the asynchronous cryptographic hash (ahash)\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle a full request\nqueue. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(infinite recursion). (CVE-2017-7618)\n\nTuomas Haanp\u00e4\u00e4 and Ari Kauppi discovered that the NFSv2 and NFSv3 server\nimplementations in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain long\nRPC replies. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2017-7645)\n\nTommi Rantala and Brad Spengler discovered that the memory manager in the\nLinux kernel did not properly enforce the CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM protection\nmechanism. A local attacker with access to /dev/mem could use this to\nexpose sensitive information or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2017-7889)\n\nTuomas Haanp\u00e4\u00e4 and Ari Kauppi discovered that the NFSv2 and NFSv3 server\nimplementations in the Linux kernel did not properly check for the end of\nbuffer. A remote attacker could use this to craft requests that cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2017-7895)\n\nIt was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the device\ndriver for XCeive xc2028/xc3028 tuners in the Linux kernel. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-7913)\n\nVlad Tsyrklevich discovered an integer overflow vulnerability in the VFIO\nPCI driver for the Linux kernel. A local attacker with access to a vfio PCI\ndevice file could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-9083, CVE-2016-9084)\n",
