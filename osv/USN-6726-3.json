  "details": "Pratyush Yadav discovered that the Xen network backend implementation in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly handle zero length data request, leading\nto a null pointer dereference vulnerability. An attacker in a guest VM\ncould possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host domain crash).\n(CVE-2023-46838)\n\nIt was discovered that the IPv6 implementation of the Linux kernel did not\nproperly manage route cache memory usage. A remote attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2023-52340)\n\nIt was discovered that the device mapper driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly validate target size during certain memory allocations. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-52429, CVE-2024-23851)\n\nDan Carpenter discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not store data in properly sized memory locations. A local user could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2024-0607)\n\nSeveral security issues were discovered in the Linux kernel.\nAn attacker could possibly use these to compromise the system.\nThis update corrects flaws in the following subsystems:\n  - Architecture specifics;\n  - Cryptographic API;\n  - Android drivers;\n  - EDAC drivers;\n  - GPU drivers;\n  - Media drivers;\n  - MTD block device drivers;\n  - Network drivers;\n  - NVME drivers;\n  - TTY drivers;\n  - Userspace I/O drivers;\n  - F2FS file system;\n  - GFS2 file system;\n  - IPv6 Networking;\n  - AppArmor security module;\n(CVE-2023-52464, CVE-2023-52448, CVE-2023-52457, CVE-2023-52443,\nCVE-2023-52439, CVE-2023-52612, CVE-2024-26633, CVE-2024-26597,\nCVE-2023-52449, CVE-2023-52444, CVE-2023-52609, CVE-2023-52469,\nCVE-2023-52445, CVE-2023-52451, CVE-2023-52470, CVE-2023-52454,\nCVE-2023-52436, CVE-2023-52438)\n",
