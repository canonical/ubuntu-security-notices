A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-42896)\n\nIt was discovered that the Xen netback driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle packets structured in certain ways. An attacker in a guest\nVM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host NIC\navailability). (CVE-2022-3643)\n\nIt was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the\nBluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2022-45934)\n",
