  "details": "Ruihan Li discovered that the bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly perform permissions checks when handling HCI sockets. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(bluetooth communication). (CVE-2023-2002)\n\nIt was discovered that the NVIDIA Tegra XUSB pad controller driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle return values in certain error\nconditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2023-23000)\n\nIt was discovered that Spectre-BHB mitigations were missing for Ampere\nprocessors. A local attacker could potentially use this to expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2023-3006)\n\nIt was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle block device modification while it is\nmounted. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-34256)\n\nEric Dumazet discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly handle DCCP conntrack buffers in certain situations,\nleading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. An attacker could possibly\nuse this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-39197)\n\nIt was discovered that the Siano USB MDTV receiver device driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle device initialization failures in\ncertain situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A physically\nproximate attacker could use this cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-4132)\n\nPratyush Yadav discovered that the Xen network backend implementation in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly handle zero length data request, leading\nto a null pointer dereference vulnerability. An attacker in a guest VM\ncould possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host domain crash).\n(CVE-2023-46838)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the AppleTalk networking\nsubsystem of the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-51781)\n\nAlon Zahavi discovered that the NVMe-oF/TCP subsystem of the Linux kernel\ndid not properly handle connect command payloads in certain situations,\nleading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could use\nthis to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-6121)\n\nIt was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle the remount operation in certain cases,\nleading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2024-0775)\n\nNotselwyn discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle verdict parameters in certain cases, leading to a use-\nafter-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2024-1086)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the SCSI Emulex\nLightPulse Fibre Channel driver in the Linux kernel when unregistering FCF\nand re-scanning an HBA FCF table, leading to a null pointer dereference\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2024-24855)\n",
