  "summary": "linux-oem-5.10 vulnerabilities",
  "details": "Ryota Shiga discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly verify that a BPF program only reserved as much memory for a\nring buffer as was allocated. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3489)\n\nManfred Paul discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly track bounds on bitwise operations. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2021-3490)\n\nBilly Jheng Bing-Jhong discovered that the io_uring implementation of the\nLinux kernel did not properly enforce the MAX_RW_COUNT limit in some\nsituations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3491)\n\nKiyin (\u5c39\u4eae) discovered that the NFC LLCP protocol implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a reference counting error. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-25670)\n\nKiyin (\u5c39\u4eae) discovered that the NFC LLCP protocol implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error\nsituations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(memory exhaustion). (CVE-2020-25671, CVE-2020-25672)\n\nIt was discovered that the Xen paravirtualization backend in the Linux\nkernel did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2021-28688)\n\nIt was discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel contained\na race condition leading to a deadlock condition. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2021-28951)\n\nJohn Stultz discovered that the audio driver for Qualcomm SDM845 systems in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly validate port ID numbers. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-28952)\n\nZygo Blaxell discovered that the btrfs file system implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a race condition during certain cloning operations.\nA local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2021-28964)\n\nVince Weaver discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle certain PEBS records properly for some Intel Haswell\nprocessors. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2021-28971)\n\nIt was discovered that the RPA PCI Hotplug driver implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle device name writes via sysfs, leading\nto a buffer overflow. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2021-28972)\n\nIt was discovered that the Freescale Gianfar Ethernet driver for the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle receive queue overrun when jumbo frames were\nenabled in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2021-29264)\n\nIt was discovered that the vDPA backend virtio driver in the Linux kernel\ncontained a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2021-29266)\n\nIt was discovered that the TIPC protocol implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate passed encryption key sizes. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2021-29646)\n\nIt was discovered that the Qualcomm IPC router implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly initialize memory passed to user space. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2021-29647)\n\nIt was discovered that the BPF user mode driver implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2021-29649)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the netfilter subsystem\nof the Linux kernel when replacing tables. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-29650)\n\nFelix Wilhelm discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel\nfor AMD processors contained race conditions on nested VMCB controls. A\nlocal attacker in a guest vm could possibly use this to gain elevated\nprivileges. (CVE-2021-29657)\n\nDan Carpenter discovered that the block device manager (dm) implementation\nin the Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow in the ioctl for listing\ndevices. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2021-31916)\n\n\u9a6c\u54f2\u5b87 discovered that the IEEE 1394 (Firewire) nosy packet sniffer\ndriver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in\nsome situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3483)\n",
