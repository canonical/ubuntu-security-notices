                "description": "It was discovered that the Marvell WiFi-Ex Driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate status lengths in messages received from an access point, leading to a buffer overflow. A physically proximate attacker controlling an access point could use this to construct messages that could possibly result in arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2020-12654)  It was discovered that memory contents previously stored in microarchitectural special registers after RDRAND, RDSEED, and SGX EGETKEY read operations on Intel client and Xeon E3 processors may be briefly exposed to processes on the same or different processor cores. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-0543)  Piotr Krysiuk discovered that race conditions existed in the file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-12114)",
