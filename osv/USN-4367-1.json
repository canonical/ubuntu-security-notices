  "summary": "linux, linux-aws, linux-azure, linux-gcp, linux-kvm, linux-oracle, linux-raspi, linux-riscv vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the btrfs implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly detect that a block was marked dirty in some situations. An\nattacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when\nunmounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-19377)\n\nIt was discovered that the linux kernel did not properly validate certain\nmount options to the tmpfs virtual memory file system. A local attacker\nwith the ability to specify mount options could use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash). (CVE-2020-11565)\n\nIt was discovered that the block layer in the Linux kernel contained a race\ncondition leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could\npossibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2020-12657)\n",
