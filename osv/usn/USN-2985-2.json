  "details": "USN-2985-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the GNU C Library. The fix for\nCVE-2014-9761 introduced a regression which affected applications that\nuse the libm library but were not fully restarted after the upgrade.\nThis update removes the fix for CVE-2014-9761 and a future update\nwill be provided to address this issue.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Martin Carpenter discovered that pt_chown in the GNU C Library did not\n properly check permissions for tty files. A local attacker could use this\n to gain administrative privileges or expose sensitive information.\n (CVE-2013-2207, CVE-2016-2856)\n \n Robin Hack discovered that the Name Service Switch (NSS) implementation in\n the GNU C Library did not properly manage its file descriptors. An attacker\n could use this to cause a denial of service (infinite loop).\n (CVE-2014-8121)\n \n Joseph Myers discovered that the GNU C Library did not properly handle long\n arguments to functions returning a representation of Not a Number (NaN). An\n attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (stack exhaustion\n leading to an application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n (CVE-2014-9761)\n \n Arjun Shankar discovered that in certain situations the nss_dns code in the\n GNU C Library did not properly account buffer sizes when passed an\n unaligned buffer. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-1781)\n \n Sumit Bose and Lukas Slebodnik discovered that the Name Service\n Switch (NSS) implementation in the GNU C Library did not handle long\n lines in the files databases correctly. A local attacker could use\n this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly\n execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-5277)\n \n Adam Nielsen discovered that the strftime function in the GNU C Library did\n not properly handle out-of-range argument data. An attacker could use this\n to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly expose\n sensitive information. (CVE-2015-8776)\n \n Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll discovered that the GNU C Library allowed\n the pointer-guarding protection mechanism to be disabled by honoring the\n LD_POINTER_GUARD environment variable across privilege boundaries. A local\n attacker could use this to exploit an existing vulnerability more easily.\n (CVE-2015-8777)\n \n Szabolcs Nagy discovered that the hcreate functions in the GNU C Library\n did not properly check its size argument, leading to an integer overflow.\n An attacker could use to cause a denial of service (application crash) or\n possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-8778)\n \n Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the\n catopen function in the GNU C Library when handling long catalog names. An\n attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or\n possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-8779)\n \n Florian Weimer discovered that the getnetbyname implementation in the GNU C\n Library did not properly handle long names passed as arguments. An attacker\n could use to cause a denial of service (stack exhaustion leading to an\n application crash). (CVE-2016-3075)\n",
