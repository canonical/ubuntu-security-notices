An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu\n16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.10. (CVE-2016-10028, CVE-2016-10029)\n\nLi Qiang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the 6300esb watchdog. A\nprivileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-10155)\n\nLi Qiang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the i.MX Fast Ethernet\nController. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to\ncause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only\naffected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.10. (CVE-2016-7907)\n\nIt was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the JAZZ RC4030 device. A\nprivileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-8667)\n\nIt was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the 16550A UART device.

A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to\ncause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute\narbitrary code on the host. In the default installation, when QEMU is used\nwith libvirt, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor profile.\n(CVE-2017-2615)\n\nIt was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the Cirrus VGA device. A\nprivileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code\non the host. In the default installation, when QEMU is used with libvirt,\nattackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor profile.\n(CVE-2017-2620)\n\nIt was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled VNC connections.
