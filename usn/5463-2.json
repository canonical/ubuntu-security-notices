  "description": "USN-5463-1 fixed vulnerabilities in NTFS-3G. This update provides the\ncorresponding updates for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM and Ubuntu 16.04 ESM.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Roman Fiedler discovered that NTFS-3G incorrectly handled certain return\n codes. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to intercept\n protocol traffic between FUSE and the kernel. (CVE-2022-30783)\n \n It was discovered that NTFS-3G incorrectly handled certain NTFS disk\n images. If a user or automated system were tricked into mounting a\n specially crafted disk image, a remote attacker could use this issue to\n cause a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n (CVE-2022-30784, CVE-2022-30786, CVE-2022-30788, CVE-2022-30789)\n \n Roman Fiedler discovered that NTFS-3G incorrectly handled certain file\n handles. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to read and write\n arbitrary memory. (CVE-2022-30785, CVE-2022-30787)\n",
