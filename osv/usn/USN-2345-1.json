  "details": "Multiple use-after-free issues were discovered in Blink. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash,\nor execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render\nprocess. (CVE-2014-3178, CVE-2014-3190, CVE-2014-3191, CVE-2014-3192)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of\nservice via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2014-3179,\nCVE-2014-3200)\n\nIt was discovered that Chromium did not properly handle the interaction of\nIPC and V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\nwebsite, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2014-3188)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in the web workers implementation in\nChromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,\nan attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service\nvia applicatin crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nuser invoking the program. (CVE-2014-3194)\n\nIt was discovered that V8 did not correctly handle Javascript heap\nallocations in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a\nspecially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\nsteal sensitive information. (CVE-2014-3195)\n\nIt was discovered that Blink did not properly provide substitute data for\npages blocked by the XSS auditor. If a user were tricked in to opening a\nspecially crafter website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\nsteal sensitive information. (CVE-2014-3197)\n\nIt was discovered that the wrap function for Event's in the V8 bindings\nin Blink produced an erroneous result in some circumstances. If a user\nwere tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to cause a denial of service by stopping a worker\nprocess that was handling an Event object. (CVE-2014-3199)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in\nto opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\nexploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via\nrenderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nsandboxed render process.
