  "summary": "lxc regression",
  "details": "USN-2753-1 fixed a vulnerability in LXC. The update caused a regression that\nprevented some containers from starting. This regression only affected\ncontainers that had an absolute path specified as a bind mount target in their\nconfiguration file. This update fixes the problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Roman Fiedler discovered a directory traversal flaw in lxc-start. A local\n attacker with access to an LXC container could exploit this flaw to run\n programs inside the container that are not confined by AppArmor or expose\n unintended files in the host to the container.\n",
