  "summary": "openjdk-7 vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the JPEGImageReader class in OpenJDK would\nincorrectly read unused image data. An attacker could use this to specially\nconstruct a jpeg image file that when opened by a Java application would\ncause a denial of service. (CVE-2017-10053)\n\nIt was discovered that the JAR verifier in OpenJDK did not properly handle\narchives containing files missing digests. An attacker could use this to\nmodify the signed contents of a JAR file. (CVE-2017-10067)\n\nIt was discovered that integer overflows existed in the Hotspot component\nof OpenJDK when generating range check loop predicates. An attacker could\nuse this to specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet\nthat could escape sandbox restrictions and cause a denial of service or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-10074)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly process parentheses in\nfunction signatures. An attacker could use this to specially construct an\nuntrusted Java application or applet that could escape sandbox\nrestrictions. (CVE-2017-10081)\n\nIt was discovered that the ThreadPoolExecutor class in OpenJDK did not\nproperly perform access control checks when cleaning up threads. An\nattacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted Java\napplication or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions and possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-10087)\n\nIt was discovered that the ServiceRegistry implementation in OpenJDK did\nnot perform access control checks in certain situations. An attacker could\nuse this to specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet\nthat escaped sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2017-10089)\n\nIt was discovered that the channel groups implementation in OpenJDK did not\nproperly perform access control checks in some situations. An attacker\ncould use this to specially construct an untrusted Java application or\napplet that could escape sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2017-10090)\n\nIt was discovered that the DTM exception handling code in the JAXP\ncomponent of OpenJDK did not properly perform access control checks. An\nattacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted Java\napplication or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions.\n(CVE-2017-10096)\n\nIt was discovered that the JAXP component of OpenJDK incorrectly granted\naccess to some internal resolvers. An attacker could use this to specially\nconstruct an untrusted Java application or applet that could escape sandbox\nrestrictions. (CVE-2017-10101)\n\nIt was discovered that the Distributed Garbage Collector (DGC) in OpenJDK\ndid not properly track references in some situations. A remote attacker\ncould possibly use this to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-10102)\n\nIt was discovered that the Activation ID implementation in the RMI\ncomponent of OpenJDK did not properly check access control permissions in\nsome situations. An attacker could use this to specially construct an\nuntrusted Java application or applet that could escape sandbox\nrestrictions. (CVE-2017-10107)\n\nIt was discovered that the BasicAttribute class in OpenJDK did not properly\nbound memory allocation when de-serializing objects. An attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (memory consumption). (CVE-2017-10108)\n\nIt was discovered that the CodeSource class in OpenJDK did not properly\nbound memory allocations when de-serializing object instances. An attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).\n(CVE-2017-10109)\n\nIt was discovered that the AWT ImageWatched class in OpenJDK did not\nproperly perform access control checks, An attacker could use this to\nspecially construct an untrusted Java application or applet that could\nescape sandbox restrictions (CVE-2017-10110)\n\nIt was discovered that a timing side-channel vulnerability existed in the\nDSA implementation in OpenJDK. An attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2017-10115)\n\nIt was discovered that the LDAP implementation in OpenJDK incorrectly\nfollowed references to non-LDAP URLs. An attacker could use this to\nspecially craft an LDAP referral URL that exposes sensitive information or\nbypass access restrictions. (CVE-2017-10116)\n\nIt was discovered that a timing side-channel vulnerability existed in the\nECDSA implementation in OpenJDK. An attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2017-10118)\n\nIlya Maykov discovered that a timing side-channel vulnerability existed in\nthe PKCS#8 implementation in OpenJDK. An attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2017-10135)\n\nIt was discovered that the Elliptic Curve (EC) implementation in OpenJDK\ndid not properly compute certain elliptic curve points. An attacker could\nuse this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-10176)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly perform access control\nchecks when handling Web Service Definition Language (WSDL) XML documents.\nAn attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2017-10243)\n",
