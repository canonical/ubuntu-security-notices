                "description": "A missing permission check when settings ACLs was discovered in nfsd. A local user could exploit this flaw to gain access to any file by setting an ACL. (CVE-2016-1237)  Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2016-5244)  James Patrick-Evans discovered that the airspy USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions. An attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (memory consumption). (CVE-2016-5400)  Yue Cao et al discovered a flaw in the TCP implementation's handling of challenge acks in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (reset connection) or inject content into an TCP stream. (CVE-2016-5696)  Pengfei Wang discovered a race condition in the MIC VOP driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2016-5728)  Cyril Bur discovered that on PowerPC platforms, the Linux kernel mishandled transactional memory state on exec(). A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5828)  It was discovered that a heap based buffer overflow existed in the USB HID driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5829)  It was discovered that the OverlayFS implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly verify dentry state before proceeding with unlink and rename operations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-6197)",
