  "summary": "linux-starfive-6.2 vulnerabilities",
  "details": "Ivan D Barrera, Christopher Bednarz, Mustafa Ismail, and Shiraz Saleem\ndiscovered that the InfiniBand RDMA driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly check for zero-length STAG or MR registration. A remote attacker\ncould possibly use this to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-25775)\n\nYu Hao and Weiteng Chen discovered that the Bluetooth HCI UART driver in\nthe Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a null pointer\ndereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-31083)\n\nYu Hao discovered that the UBI driver in the Linux kernel did not properly\ncheck for MTD with zero erasesize during device attachment. A local\nprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2023-31085)\n\nLin Ma discovered that the Netlink Transformation (XFRM) subsystem in the\nLinux kernel contained a null pointer dereference vulnerability in some\nsituations. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2023-3772)\n\nChih-Yen Chang discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate SMB request protocol IDs, leading to a out-of-\nbounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-38430)\n\nChih-Yen Chang discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate command payload size, leading to a out-of-bounds\nread vulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-38432)\n\nIt was discovered that the NFC implementation in the Linux kernel contained\na use-after-free vulnerability when performing peer-to-peer communication\nin certain conditions. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information\n(kernel memory). (CVE-2023-3863)\n\nLaurence Wit discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate a buffer size in certain situations, leading to\nan out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2023-3865)\n\nLaurence Wit discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel\ncontained a null pointer dereference vulnerability when handling handling\nchained requests. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2023-3866)\n\nIt was discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle session setup requests, leading to an out-of-bounds read\nvulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2023-3867)\n\nIt was discovered that the Siano USB MDTV receiver device driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle device initialization failures in\ncertain situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A physically\nproximate attacker could use this cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-4132)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Cypress touchscreen\ndriver in the Linux kernel during device removal, leading to a use-after-\nfree vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause\na denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-4134)\n\nThelford Williams discovered that the Ceph file system messenger protocol\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate frame segment\nlength in certain situation, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability. A\nremote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-44466)\n\nManfred Rudigier discovered that the Intel(R) PCI-Express Gigabit (igb)\nEthernet driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate received\nframes that are larger than the set MTU size, leading to a buffer overflow\nvulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-45871)\n\nMaxim Levitsky discovered that the KVM nested virtualization (SVM)\nimplementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel did not properly\nhandle x2AVIC MSRs. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (host kernel crash). (CVE-2023-5090)\n\nIt was discovered that the SMB network file sharing protocol implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions,\nleading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2023-5345)\n\n",
