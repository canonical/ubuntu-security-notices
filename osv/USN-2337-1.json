  "summary": "linux vulnerabilities",
  "details": "A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel virtual machine's (kvm)\nvalidation of interrupt requests (irq). A guest OS user could exploit this\nflaw to cause a denial of service (host OS crash). (CVE-2014-0155)\n\nAndy Lutomirski discovered a flaw in the authorization of netlink socket\noperations when a socket is passed to a process of more privilege. A local\nuser could exploit this flaw to bypass access restrictions by having a\nprivileged executable do something it was not intended to do.\n(CVE-2014-0181)\n\nAn information leak was discovered in the Linux kernels\naio_read_events_ring function. A local user could exploit this flaw to\nobtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.\n(CVE-2014-0206)\n\nA flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's implementation of user\nnamespaces with respect to inode permissions. A local user could exploit\nthis flaw by creating a user namespace to gain administrative privileges.\n(CVE-2014-4014)\n\nAn information leak was discovered in the rd_mcp backend of the iSCSI\ntarget subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw\nto obtain sensitive information from ramdisk_mcp memory by leveraging\naccess to a SCSI initiator. (CVE-2014-4027)\n\nSasha Levin reported an issue with the Linux kernel's shared memory\nsubsystem when used with range notifications and hole punching. A local\nuser could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2014-4171)\n\nToralf F\u00f6rster reported an error in the Linux kernels syscall auditing on\n32 bit x86 platforms. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a\ndenial of service (OOPS and system crash). (CVE-2014-4508)\n\nAn information leak was discovered in the control implemenation of the\nAdvanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem in the Linux kernel. A\nlocal user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from\nkernel memory. (CVE-2014-4652)\n\nA use-after-free flaw was discovered in the Advanced Linux Sound\nArchitecture (ALSA) control implementation of the Linux kernel. A local\nuser could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2014-4653)\n\nA authorization bug was discovered with the snd_ctl_elem_add function of\nthe Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) in the Linux kernel. A local\nuser could exploit his bug to cause a denial of service (remove kernel\ncontrols). (CVE-2014-4654)\n\nA flaw discovered in how the snd_ctl_elem function of the Advanced Linux\nSound Architecture (ALSA) handled a reference count. A local user could\nexploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and limit\nbypass). (CVE-2014-4655)\n\nAn integer overflow flaw was discovered in the control implementation of\nthe Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA). A local user could exploit\nthis flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2014-4656)\n\nAn integer underflow flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's handling of\nthe backlog value for certain SCTP packets. A remote attacker could exploit\nthis flaw to cause a denial of service (socket outage) via a crafted SCTP\npacket. (CVE-2014-4667)\n\nVasily Averin discover a reference count flaw during attempts to umount in\nconjunction with a symlink. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a\ndenial of service (memory consumption or use after free) or possibly have\nother unspecified impact. (CVE-2014-5045)\n",
