                "description": "It was discovered that the System V IPC implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle large shared memory counts. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-3669)  It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the SGI GRU driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3424)  Ziming Zhang discovered that the VMware Virtual GPU DRM driver in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-36280)  Hyunwoo Kim discovered that the DVB Core driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-41218)  It was discovered that the network queuing discipline implementation in the Linux kernel contained a null pointer dereference in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-47929)  Jos\u00e9 Oliveira and Rodrigo Branco discovered that the prctl syscall implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly protect against indirect branch prediction attacks in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-0045)  It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-0266)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel contained a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-0394)  Kyle Zeng discovered that the ATM VC queuing discipline implementation in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-23455)  It was discovered that the RNDIS USB driver in the Linux kernel contained an integer overflow vulnerability. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a malicious USB device to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-23559)  Wei Chen discovered that the DVB USB AZ6027 driver in the Linux kernel contained a null pointer dereference when handling certain messages from user space. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-28328)",
