  "summary": "linux-oem-5.14 vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the NFSD implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle some RPC messages, leading to a buffer overflow. A remote\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-43945)\n\nJann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly track memory\nallocations for anonymous VMA mappings in some situations, leading to\npotential data structure reuse. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2022-42703)\n\nRoger Pau Monn\u00e9 discovered that the Xen virtual block driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly initialize memory pages to be used for shared\ncommunication with the backend. A local attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information (guest kernel memory). (CVE-2022-26365)\n\nJan Beulich discovered that the Xen network device frontend driver in the\nLinux kernel incorrectly handled socket buffers (skb) references when\ncommunicating with certain backends. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (guest crash). (CVE-2022-33743)\n\nIt was discovered that a memory leak existed in the IPv6 implementation of\nthe Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2022-3524)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Bluetooth subsystem\nin the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3564)\n\nIt was discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel contained\na data race condition. An attacker could possibly use this to cause\nundesired behaviors. (CVE-2022-3566)\n\nIt was discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel\ncontained a data race condition. An attacker could possibly use this to\ncause undesired behaviors. (CVE-2022-3567)\n\nIt was discovered that the Realtek RTL8152 USB Ethernet adapter driver in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions. A local\nattacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device\nto cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2022-3594)\n\nIt was discovered that a null pointer dereference existed in the NILFS2\nfile system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3621)\n\n",
