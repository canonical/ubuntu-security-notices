  "details": "Gaoning Pan discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the floppy disk\nemulator. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU\nto crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2021-20196)\n\nGaoning Pan discovered that the QEMU vmxnet3 NIC emulator incorrectly\nhandled certain values. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue\nto cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2021-20203)\n\nIt was discovered that the QEMU vhost-user GPU device contained several\nsecurity issues. An attacker inside the guest could use these issues to\ncause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, leak sensitive\ninformation, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected\nUbuntu 21.10. (CVE-2021-3544, CVE-2021-3545, CVE-2021-3546)\n\nIt was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled bulk transfers from SPICE\nclients. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash,\nresulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2021-3682)\n\nIt was discovered that the QEMU UAS device emulation incorrectly handled\ncertain stream numbers. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue\nto cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 21.10.\n(CVE-2021-3713)\n\nIt was discovered that the QEMU virtio-net device incorrectly handled\ncertain buffer addresses. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue\nto cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code.  (CVE-2021-3748)\n\nIt was discovered that the QEMU SCSI device emulation incorrectly handled\ncertain MODE SELECT commands. An attacker inside the guest could possibly\nuse this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n(CVE-2021-3930)\n\nIt was discovered that the QEMU ACPI logic incorrectly handled certain\nvalues. An attacker inside the guest could possibly use this issue to cause\nQEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected\nUbuntu 21.10. (CVE-2021-4158)\n\nJietao Xiao, Jinku Li, Wenbo Shen, and Nanzi Yang discovered that the QEMU\nvirtiofsd device incorrectly handled permissions when creating files. An\nattacker inside the guest could use this issue to create files inside the\ndirectory shared by virtiofs with unintended permissions, possibly allowing\nprivilege escalation. This issue only affected Ubuntu 21.10.\n(CVE-2022-0358)\n",
