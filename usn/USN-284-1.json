  "description": "Paul Jakma discovered that Quagga's ripd daemon did not properly\nhandle authentication of RIPv1 requests. If the RIPv1 protocol had\nbeen disabled, or authentication for RIPv2 had been enabled, ripd\nstill replied to RIPv1 requests, which could lead to information\ndisclosure. (CVE-2006-2223)\n\nPaul Jakma also noticed that ripd accepted unauthenticated RIPv1\nresponse packets if RIPv2 was configured to require authentication and\nboth protocols were allowed. A remote attacker could exploit this to\ninject arbitrary routes. (CVE-2006-2224)\n\nFredrik Widell discovered that Quagga did not properly handle certain\ninvalid 'sh ip bgp' commands. By sending special commands to Quagga, a\nremote attacker with telnet access to the Quagga server could exploit\nthis to trigger an endless loop in the daemon (Denial of Service).\n(CVE-2006-2276)",
