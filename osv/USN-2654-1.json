  "details": "It was discovered that the Tomcat XML parser incorrectly handled XML\nExternal Entities (XXE). A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to\nread arbitrary files. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\n(CVE-2014-0119)\n\nIt was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly handled data with malformed\nchunked transfer coding. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to\nconduct HTTP request smuggling attacks, or cause Tomcat to consume\nresources, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected\nUbuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2014-0227)\n\nIt was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly handled HTTP responses occurring\nbefore the entire request body was finished being read. A remote attacker\ncould possibly use this issue to cause a limited denial of service. This\nissue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2014-0230)\n\nIt was discovered that the Tomcat Expression Language (EL) implementation\nincorrectly handled accessible interfaces implemented by inaccessible\nclasses. An attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass a\nSecurityManager protection mechanism. (CVE-2014-7810)\n",
