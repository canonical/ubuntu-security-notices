  "details": "It was discovered that the IP-VLAN network driver for the Linux kernel did\nnot properly initialize memory in some situations, leading to an out-of-\nbounds write vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3090)\n\nShir Tamari and Sagi Tzadik discovered that the OverlayFS implementation in\nthe Ubuntu Linux kernel did not properly perform permission checks in\ncertain situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain\nelevated privileges. (CVE-2023-32629)\n\nIt was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle some error conditions, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3390)\n\nTanguy Dubroca discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly handle certain pointer data type, leading to an out-of-\nbounds write vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-35001)\n\n",
