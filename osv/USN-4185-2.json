  "details": "Stephan van Schaik, Alyssa Milburn, Sebastian \u00d6sterlund, Pietro Frigo,\nKaveh Razavi, Herbert Bos, Cristiano Giuffrida, Giorgi Maisuradze, Moritz\nLipp, Michael Schwarz, Daniel Gruss, and Jo Van Bulck discovered that Intel\nprocessors using Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX) could\nexpose memory contents previously stored in microarchitectural buffers to a\nmalicious process that is executing on the same CPU core. A local attacker\ncould use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-11135)\n\nDeepak Gupta discovered that on certain Intel processors, the Linux kernel\ndid not properly perform invalidation on page table updates by virtual\nguest operating systems. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to\ncause a denial of service (host system crash). (CVE-2018-12207)\n\nOri Nimron discovered that the AX25 network protocol implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks. A local attacker\ncould use this to create a raw socket. (CVE-2019-17052)\n\nOri Nimron discovered that the IEEE 802.15.4 Low-Rate Wireless network\nprotocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform\npermissions checks. A local attacker could use this to create a raw socket.\n(CVE-2019-17053)\n\nOri Nimron discovered that the Appletalk network protocol implementation in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks. A local\nattacker could use this to create a raw socket. (CVE-2019-17054)\n\nOri Nimron discovered that the modular ISDN network protocol implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks. A local\nattacker could use this to create a raw socket. (CVE-2019-17055)\n\nOri Nimron discovered that the Near field Communication (NFC) network\nprotocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform\npermissions checks. A local attacker could use this to create a raw socket.\n(CVE-2019-17056)\n",
