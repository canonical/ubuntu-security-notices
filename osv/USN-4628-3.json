This update provides the corresponding updates for some additional\nprocessor types.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Moritz Lipp, Michael Schwarz, Andreas Kogler, David Oswald, Catherine\n Easdon, Claudio Canella, and Daniel Gruss discovered that the Intel Running\n Average Power Limit (RAPL) feature of some Intel processors allowed a side-\n channel attack based on power consumption measurements. A local attacker\n could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-8695)\n \n Ezra Caltum, Joseph Nuzman, Nir Shildan and Ofir Joseff discovered that\n some Intel(R) Processors did not properly remove sensitive information\n before storage or transfer in some situations. A local attacker could\n possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-8696)\n \n Ezra Caltum, Joseph Nuzman, Nir Shildan and Ofir Joseff discovered that\n some Intel(R) Processors did not properly isolate shared resources in some\n situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive\n information. (CVE-2020-8698)\n",
