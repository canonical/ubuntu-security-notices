  "summary": "linux-aws-hwe, linux-oracle vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the Upper Level Protocol (ULP) subsystem in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle sockets entering the LISTEN state in\ncertain protocols, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-0461)\n\nKyle Zeng discovered that the sysctl implementation in the Linux kernel\ncontained a stack-based buffer overflow. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2022-4378)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Kernel Connection\nMultiplexor (KCM) socket implementation in the Linux kernel when releasing\nsockets in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3521)\n\nIt was discovered that the Netronome Ethernet driver in the Linux kernel\ncontained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2022-3545)\n\nIt was discovered that the Broadcom FullMAC USB WiFi driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to craft a malicious USB\ndevice that when inserted, could cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3628)\n\nIt was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the\nBluetooth stack in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2022-3640)\n\nIt was discovered that the NILFS2 file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. An\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2022-3646)\n\nKhalid Masum discovered that the NILFS2 file system implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a\nuse-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3649)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Xen network backend\ndriver in the Linux kernel when handling dropped packets in certain\ncircumstances. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(kernel deadlock). (CVE-2022-42328, CVE-2022-42329)\n\nTam\u00e1s Koczka discovered that the Bluetooth L2CAP implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly initialize memory in some situations. A\nphysically proximate attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive\ninformation (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-42895)\n\nIt was discovered that the USB monitoring (usbmon) component in the Linux\nkernel did not properly set permissions on memory mapped in to user space\nprocesses. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-43750)\n\n",
