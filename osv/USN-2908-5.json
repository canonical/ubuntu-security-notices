  "details": "USN-2908-2 fixed vulnerabilities in the Ubuntu 15.10 Linux kernel\nbackported to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. An incorrect locking fix caused a\nregression that broke graphics displays for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS guests\nrunning the Ubuntu 15.10 backport kernel within VMWare virtual\nmachines. This update fixes the problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n halfdog discovered that OverlayFS, when mounting on top of a FUSE mount,\n incorrectly propagated file attributes, including setuid. A local\n unprivileged attacker could use this to gain privileges. (CVE-2016-1576)\n\n halfdog discovered that OverlayFS in the Linux kernel incorrectly\n propagated security sensitive extended attributes, such as POSIX ACLs. A\n local unprivileged attacker could use this to gain privileges.\n (CVE-2016-1575)\n\n It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly enforce rlimits\n for file descriptors sent over UNIX domain sockets. A local attacker could\n use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2013-4312)\n\n It was discovered that the Linux kernel's Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE)\n implementation did not handle initial zero length segments properly. A\n local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (unkillable\n task). (CVE-2015-8785)\n\n Andy Lutomirski discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel's\n translation lookaside buffer (TLB) handling of flush events. A local\n attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly leak\n sensitive information. (CVE-2016-2069)\n",
