  "description": "\nRyan Sweat discovered that the kernel incorrectly handled certain VLAN\npackets. On some systems, a remote attacker could send specially crafted\ntraffic to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.\n(CVE-2011-1576)\n\nVasiliy Kulikov and Dan Rosenberg discovered that ecryptfs did not\ncorrectly check the origin of mount points. A local attacker could exploit\nthis to trick the system into unmounting arbitrary mount points, leading to\na denial of service. (CVE-2011-1833)\n\nVasiliy Kulikov discovered that taskstats did not enforce access\nrestrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain\ninformation, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2494)\n\nVasiliy Kulikov discovered that /proc/PID/io did not enforce access\nrestrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain\ninformation, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2495)\n\nDan Rosenberg discovered that the Bluetooth stack incorrectly handled\ncertain L2CAP requests. If a system was using Bluetooth, a remote attacker\ncould send specially crafted traffic to crash the system or gain root\nprivileges. (CVE-2011-2497)\n\nIt was discovered that the EXT4 filesystem contained multiple off-by-one\nflaws. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to\na denial of service. (CVE-2011-2695)\n\nFernando Gont discovered that the IPv6 stack used predictable fragment\nidentification numbers. A remote attacker could exploit this to exhaust\nnetwork resources, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2699)\n\nChristian Ohm discovered that the perf command looks for configuration\nfiles in the current directory. If a privileged user were tricked into\nrunning perf in a directory containing a malicious configuration file, an\nattacker could run arbitrary commands and possibly gain privileges.\n(CVE-2011-2905)\n\nTime Warns discovered that long symlinks were incorrectly handled on Be\nfilesystems. A local attacker could exploit this with a malformed Be\nfilesystem and crash the system, leading to a denial of service.\n(CVE-2011-2928)\n\nDan Kaminsky discovered that the kernel incorrectly handled random sequence\nnumber generation. An attacker could use this flaw to possibly predict\nsequence numbers and inject packets. (CVE-2011-3188)\n\nDarren Lavender discovered that the CIFS client incorrectly handled certain\nlarge values. A remote attacker with a malicious server could exploit this\nto crash the system or possibly execute arbitrary code as the root user.\n(CVE-2011-3191)\n\nHan-Wen Nienhuys reported a flaw in the FUSE kernel module. A local user\nwho can mount a FUSE file system could cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2011-3353)\n\nGideon Naim discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling VLAN 0 frames.\nAn attacker on the local network could exploit this flaw to cause a denial\nof service.
