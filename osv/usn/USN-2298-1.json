  "details": "A type confusion bug was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2014-1730)\n\nA type confusion bug was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2014-1731)\n\nMultiple security issues including memory safety bugs were discovered in\nChromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,\nan attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via\napplication crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nuser invoking the program. (CVE-2014-1735, CVE-2014-3162)\n\nMultiple use-after-free issues were discovered in the WebSockets\nimplementation. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\nwebsite, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of\nservice via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2014-1740)\n\nMultiple integer overflows were discovered in CharacterData\nimplementation. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\nwebsite, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of\nservice via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges\nof the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2014-1741)\n\nMultiple use-after-free issues were discovered in Blink. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash\nor execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render\nprocess. (CVE-2014-1742, CVE-2014-1743)\n\nAn integer overflow bug was discovered in Chromium. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application\ncrash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking\nthe program. (CVE-2014-1744)\n\nAn out-of-bounds read was discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked\nin to opening a specially crafter website, an attacker could potentially\nexploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash.\n(CVE-2014-1746)\n\nIt was discovered that Blink allowed scrollbar painting to extend in to\nthe parent frame in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially\nexploit this to conduct clickjacking attacks via UI redress.\n(CVE-2014-1748)\n\nAn integer underflow was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafter website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2014-3152)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in Chromium. If a use were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the sandboxed render process.\n(CVE-2014-3154)\n\nA security issue was discovered in the SPDY implementation. An attacker\ncould potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via\napplication crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nuser invoking the program. (CVE-2014-3155)\n\nA heap overflow was discovered in Chromium. If a use were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2014-3157)\n\nIt was discovered that Blink did not enforce security rules for\nsubresource loading in SVG images. If a user opened a site that embedded a\nspecially crafted image, an attacker could exploit this to log page views.\n(CVE-2014-3160)\n\nIt was discovered that the SpeechInput feature in Blink could be activated\nwithout consent or any visible indication. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could exploit this to\neavesdrop on the user. (CVE-2014-3803)\n",
