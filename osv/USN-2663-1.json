  "details": "Alexandre Oliva reported a race condition flaw in the btrfs file system's\nhandling of extended attributes (xattrs). A local attacker could exploit\nthis flaw to bypass ACLs and potentially escalate privileges.\n(CVE-2014-9710)\n\nA race condition was discovered in the Linux kernel's file_handle size\nverification. A local user could exploit this flaw to read potentially\nsensative memory locations. (CVE-2015-1420)\n\nA underflow error was discovered in the Linux kernel's Ozmo Devices USB\nover WiFi host controller driver. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially execute\narbitrary code via a specially crafted packet. (CVE-2015-4001)\n\nA bounds check error was discovered in the Linux kernel's Ozmo Devices USB\nover WiFi host controller driver. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially execute\narbitrary code via a specially crafted packet. (CVE-2015-4002)\n\nA division by zero error was discovered in the Linux kernel's Ozmo Devices\nUSB over WiFi host controller driver. A remote attacker could exploit this\nflaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-4003)\n\nCarl H Lunde discovered missing consistency checks in the Linux kernel's UDF\nfile system (CONFIG_UDF_FS). A local attacker could exploit this flaw to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) by using a corrupted file system\nimage. (CVE-2015-4167)\n",
