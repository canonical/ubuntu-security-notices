  "details": "It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference existed in the keyring\nsubsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-2647)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the raw MIDI driver for\nthe Linux kernel, leading to a double free vulnerability. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-10902)\n\nIt was discovered that an integer overrun vulnerability existed in the\nPOSIX timers implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-12896)\n\nNoam Rathaus discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the\nInfiniband implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-14734)\n\nIt was discovered that the YUREX USB device driver for the Linux kernel did\nnot properly restrict user space reads or writes. A physically proximate\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-16276)\n\nTetsuo Handa discovered a logic error in the TTY subsystem of the Linux\nkernel. A local attacker with access to pseudo terminal devices could use\nthis to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-18386)\n\nKanda Motohiro discovered that writing extended attributes to an XFS file\nsystem in the Linux kernel in certain situations could cause an error\ncondition to occur. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2018-18690)\n\nIt was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the\nCDROM driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2018-18710)\n",
