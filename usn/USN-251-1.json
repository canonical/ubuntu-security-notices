  "description": "Evgeny Legerov discovered a buffer overflow in the DER format decoding\nfunction of the libtasn library. This library is mainly used by the\nGNU TLS library; by sending a specially crafted X.509 certificate to a\nserver which uses TLS encryption/authentication, a remote attacker\ncould exploit this to crash that server process and possibly even\nexecute arbitrary code with the privileges of that server.\n\nIn order to fix the vulnerability in libtasn, several internal\nfunction signatures had to be changed; some of these functions are\nused by the GNU TLS library, so that library needs to be updated as\nwell.",
