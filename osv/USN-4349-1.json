  "details": "A buffer overflow was discovered in the network stack. An unprivileged user\ncould potentially enable escalation of privilege and/or denial of service.\nThis issue was already fixed in a previous release for 18.04 LTS and 19.10.\n(CVE-2018-12178)\n\nA buffer overflow was discovered in BlockIo service. An unauthenticated user\ncould potentially enable escalation of privilege, information disclosure and/or\ndenial of service. This issue was already fixed in a previous release for 18.04\nLTS and 19.10. (CVE-2018-12180)\n\nA stack overflow was discovered in bmp. An unprivileged user\ncould potentially enable denial of service or elevation of privilege via\nlocal access. This issue was already fixed in a previous release for 18.04\nLTS and 19.10. (CVE-2018-12181)\n\nIt was discovered that memory was not cleared before free that could lead\nto potential password leak. (CVE-2019-14558)\n\nA memory leak was discovered in ArpOnFrameRcvdDpc. An attacker could\npossibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or other unspecified\nimpact. (CVE-2019-14559)\n\nAn integer overflow was discovered in MdeModulePkg/PiDxeS3BootScriptLib.\nAn attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or\nother unspecified impact. (CVE-2019-14563)\n\nIt was discovered that the affected version doesn't properly check whether an\nunsigned EFI file should be allowed or not. An attacker could possibly load\nunsafe content by bypassing the verification. (CVE-2019-14575)\n\nIt was discovered that original configuration runtime memory is freed, but it\nis still exposed to the OS runtime. (CVE-2019-14586)\n\nA double-unmap was discovered in TRB creation. An attacker could use it to\ncause a denial of service or other unspecified impact. (CVE-2019-14587)\n",
