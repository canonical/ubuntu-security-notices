  "details": "Matthew Sheets discovered that the SELinux network label handling\nimplementation in the Linux kernel could be coerced into de-referencing a\nNULL pointer. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2020-10711)\n\nIt was discovered that the SCSI generic (sg) driver in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle certain error conditions correctly. A local privileged\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2020-12770)\n\nIt was discovered that the USB Gadget device driver in the Linux kernel did\nnot validate arguments passed from configfs in some situations. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-13143)\n\nDmitry Vyukov discovered that the SELinux netlink security hook in the\nLinux kernel did not validate messages in some situations. A privileged\nattacker could use this to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.\n(CVE-2020-10751)\n\nIt was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly deallocate memory on initialization for some processors. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2020-12768)\n",
