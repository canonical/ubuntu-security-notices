                "description": "USN-4167-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in Samba. This update provides the corresponding update for Ubuntu 12.04 ESM and Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.  Original advisory details:   Michael Hanselmann discovered that the Samba client code incorrectly  handled path separators. If a user were tricked into connecting to a  malicious server, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause the  client to access local pathnames instead of network pathnames.  (CVE-2019-10218)   Adam Xu discovered that Samba incorrectly handled the dirsync LDAP control.  A remote attacker with \"get changes\" permissions could possibly use this  issue to cause Samba to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue  only affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM. (CVE-2019-14847)",
