  "details": "Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial\nof service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-1705)\n\nIt was discovered that the PPAPI implementation does not validate the\norigin of IPC messages to the plugin broker process. A remote attacker\ncould potentially exploit this to bypass sandbox protection mechanisms.\n(CVE-2016-1706)\n\nIt was discovered that Blink does not prevent window creation by a\ndeferred frame. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass\nsame origin restrictions. (CVE-2016-1710)\n\nIt was discovered that Blink does not disable frame navigation during a\ndetach operation on a DocumentLoader object. A remote attacker could\npotentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions.\n(CVE-2016-1711)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service via renderer process crash, or execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5127)\n\nIt was discovered that objects.cc in V8 does not prevent API interceptors\nfrom modifying a store target without setting a property. A remote\nattacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin\nrestrictions. (CVE-2016-5128)\n\nA memory corruption was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service via renderer process crash, or execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5129)\n\nA security issue was discovered in Chromium. A remote attacker could\npotentially exploit this to spoof the currently displayed URL.\n(CVE-2016-5130)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in libxml. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service via renderer process crash, or execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5131)\n\nThe Service Workers implementation in Chromium does not properly implement\nthe Secure Contexts specification during decisions about whether to\ncontrol a subframe. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to\nbypass same origin restrictions. (CVE-2016-5132)\n\nIt was discovered that Chromium mishandles origin information during proxy\nauthentication. A machine-in-the-middle attacker could potentially exploit this\nto spoof a proxy authentication login prompt. (CVE-2016-5133)\n\nIt was discovered that the Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) feature in Chromium\ndoes not ensure that URL information is restricted to a scheme, host and\nport. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2016-5134)\n\nIt was discovered that Blink does not consider referrer-policy information\ninside an HTML document during a preload request. A remote attacker could\npotentially exploit this to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP)\nprotections. (CVE-2016-5135)\n\nIt was discovered that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in\nBlink does not apply http :80 policies to https :443 URLs. A remote\nattacker could potentially exploit this to determine whether a specific\nHSTS web site has been visited by reading a CSP report. (CVE-2016-5137)\n",
