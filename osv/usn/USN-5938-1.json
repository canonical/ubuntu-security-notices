  "details": "It was discovered that the Upper Level Protocol (ULP) subsystem in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle sockets entering the LISTEN state in\ncertain protocols, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-0461)\n\nDavide Ornaghi discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly handle VLAN headers in some situations. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-0179)\n\nIt was discovered that the NVMe driver in the Linux kernel did not properly\nhandle reset events in some situations. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3169)\n\nMaxim Levitsky discovered that the KVM nested virtualization (SVM)\nimplementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel did not properly\nhandle nested shutdown execution. An attacker in a guest vm could use this\nto cause a denial of service (host kernel crash) (CVE-2022-3344)\n\nGwangun Jung discovered a race condition in the IPv4 implementation in the\nLinux kernel when deleting multipath routes, resulting in an out-of-bounds\nread. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2022-3435)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Kernel Connection\nMultiplexor (KCM) socket implementation in the Linux kernel when releasing\nsockets in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3521)\n\nIt was discovered that the Netronome Ethernet driver in the Linux kernel\ncontained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2022-3545)\n\nIt was discovered that the Intel i915 graphics driver in the Linux kernel\ndid not perform a GPU TLB flush in some situations. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2022-4139)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Xen network backend\ndriver in the Linux kernel when handling dropped packets in certain\ncircumstances. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(kernel deadlock). (CVE-2022-42328, CVE-2022-42329)\n\nIt was discovered that the NFSD implementation in the Linux kernel\ncontained a use-after-free vulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2022-4379)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the x86 KVM subsystem\nimplementation in the Linux kernel when nested virtualization and the TDP\nMMU are enabled. An attacker in a guest vm could use this to cause a denial\nof service (host OS crash). (CVE-2022-45869)\n\nIt was discovered that the Atmel WILC1000 driver in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly validate the number of channels, leading to an out-of-bounds\nwrite vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-47518)\n\nIt was discovered that the Atmel WILC1000 driver in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly validate specific attributes, leading to an out-of-bounds\nwrite vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-47519)\n\nIt was discovered that the Atmel WILC1000 driver in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly validate offsets, leading to an out-of-bounds read\nvulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2022-47520)\n\nIt was discovered that the Atmel WILC1000 driver in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly validate specific attributes, leading to a heap-based buffer\noverflow. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-47521)\n\nLin Ma discovered a race condition in the io_uring subsystem in the Linux\nkernel, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-0468)\n\nIt was discovered that the file system writeback functionality in the Linux\nkernel contained a user-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could\npossibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2023-26605)\n\n",
