  "details": "It was discovered that a type confusion error existed in libxml2. An\nattacker could use this to specially construct XML data that\ncould cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2017-0663)\n\nIt was discovered that libxml2 did not properly validate parsed entity\nreferences. An attacker could use this to specially construct XML\ndata that could expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-7375)\n\nIt was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in libxml2 when\nhandling HTTP redirects. An attacker could use this to specially\nconstruct XML data that could cause a denial of service or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-7376)\n\nMarcel B\u00f6hme and Van-Thuan Pham discovered a buffer overflow in\nlibxml2 when handling elements. An attacker could use this to specially\nconstruct XML data that could cause a denial of service or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-9047)\n\nMarcel B\u00f6hme and Van-Thuan Pham discovered a buffer overread\nin libxml2 when handling elements. An attacker could use this\nto specially construct XML data that could cause a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2017-9048)\n\nMarcel B\u00f6hme and Van-Thuan Pham discovered multiple buffer overreads\nin libxml2 when handling parameter-entity references. An attacker\ncould use these to specially construct XML data that could cause a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2017-9049, CVE-2017-9050)\n",
