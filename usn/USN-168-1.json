  "description": "Daniel Atallah discovered a Denial of Service vulnerability in the\nfile transfer handler of OSCAR (the module that handles various\ninstant messaging protocols like ICQ). A remote attacker could crash\nthe Gaim client of an user by attempting to send him a file with\na name that contains invalid UTF-8 characters. (CAN-2005-2102)\n\nIt was found that specially crafted \"away\" messages triggered a buffer\noverflow. A remote attacker could exploit this to crash the Gaim\nclient or possibly even execute arbitrary code with the permissions of\nthe Gaim user. (CAN-2005-2103)\n\nSzymon Zygmunt and Micha\u0142 Bartoszkiewicz discovered a memory alignment\nerror in the Gadu library, which was fixed in USN-162-1. However, it\nwas discovered that Gaim contains a copy of the vulnerable code. By\nsending specially crafted messages over the Gadu protocol, a remote\nattacker could crash Gaim. (CAN-2005-2370)",
