A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass certain validations. (CVE-2019-10190)  Vladim\u00edr \u010cun\u00e1t discovered that Knot Resolver incorrectly handled input during DNSSEC validation. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to downgrade DNSSEC-secure domains to a DNSSEC-insecure state, resulting  in a domain hijacking attack. (CVE-2019-10191)  Vladim\u00edr \u010cun\u00e1t discovered that Knot Resolver incorrectly handled certain  DNS replies with many resource records. An attacker could possibly use  this issue to consume system resources, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2019-19331)  Lior Shafir, Yehuda Afek, and Anat Bremler-Barr discovered that Knot Resolver incorrectly handled certain queries. A remote attacker could  use this issue to perform an amplification attack directed at a target. (CVE-2020-12667)",
