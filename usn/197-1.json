  "description": "A firewall bypass vulnerability has been found in shorewall. If\nMACLIST_TTL was set to a value greater than 0 or MACLIST_DISPOSITION\nwas set to \"ACCEPT\" in /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf, and a client was\npositively identified through its MAC address, that client bypassed\nall other policies/rules in place. This could allow external computers\nto get access to ports that are intended to be restricted by the\nfirewall policy.\n\nPlease note that this does not affect the default configuration, which\ndoes not enable MAC based client identification.",
