  "summary": "linux, linux-aws, linux-kvm, linux-lts-xenial, linux-raspi2, linux-snapdragon vulnerabilities",
  "details": "Hadar Manor discovered that the DCCP protocol implementation in the Linux\nkernel improperly handled socket reuse, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-16119)\n\nWen Xu discovered that the XFS file system in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly validate inode metadata in some situations. An attacker could use\nthis to construct a malicious XFS image that, when mounted, could cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-10322)\n\nJay Shin discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle directory access with broken indexing,\nleading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-14314)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the hugetlb sysctl\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A privileged attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-25285)\n",
