                "description": "Ruihan Li discovered that the bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks when handling HCI sockets. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (bluetooth communication). (CVE-2023-2002)  It was discovered that the NVIDIA Tegra XUSB pad controller driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle return values in certain error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-23000)  It was discovered that Spectre-BHB mitigations were missing for Ampere processors. A local attacker could potentially use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-3006)  It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle block device modification while it is mounted. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-34256)  Eric Dumazet discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle DCCP conntrack buffers in certain situations, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-39197)  It was discovered that the Siano USB MDTV receiver device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device initialization failures in certain situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-4132)  Pratyush Yadav discovered that the Xen network backend implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle zero length data request, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host domain crash). (CVE-2023-46838)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the AppleTalk networking subsystem of the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-51781)  Alon Zahavi discovered that the NVMe-oF/TCP subsystem of the Linux kernel did not properly handle connect command payloads in certain situations, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-6121)  It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle the remount operation in certain cases, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2024-0775)  Notselwyn discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle verdict parameters in certain cases, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-1086)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the SCSI Emulex LightPulse Fibre Channel driver in the Linux kernel when unregistering FCF and re-scanning an HBA FCF table, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2024-24855)",
