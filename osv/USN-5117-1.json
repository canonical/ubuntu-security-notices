  "summary": "linux-oem-5.13 vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle removing a non-existent device id. An attacker with\nCAP_SYS_ADMIN could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2021-3739)\n\nIt was discovered that the Qualcomm IPC Router protocol implementation in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly validate metadata in some situations. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-3743)\n\nIt was discovered that the virtual terminal (vt) device implementation in\nthe Linux kernel contained a race condition in its ioctl handling that led\nto an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use\nthis to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-3753)\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly account for the\nmemory usage of certain IPC objects. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-3759)\n",
