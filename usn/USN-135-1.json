  "description": "Tavis Ormandy found an integer overflow in the GNU debugger. By\ntricking an user into merely load a specially crafted executable, an\nattacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user running gdb. However, loading untrusted\nbinaries without actually executing them is rather uncommon, so the\nrisk of this flaw is low. (CAN-2005-1704)\n\nTavis Ormandy also discovered that gdb loads and executes the file\n\".gdbinit\" in the current directory even if the file belongs to a\ndifferent user. By tricking an user into run gdb in a directory with a\nmalicious .gdbinit file, a local attacker could exploit this to run\narbitrary commands with the privileges of the user invoking gdb.\n(CAN-2005-1705)",
