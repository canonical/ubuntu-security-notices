  "details": "USN-6560-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in OpenSSH. This update provides\nthe corresponding update for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Fabian B\u00e4umer, Marcus Brinkmann, J\u00f6rg Schwenk discovered that the SSH\n protocol was vulnerable to a prefix truncation attack. If a remote attacker\n was able to intercept SSH communications, extension negotiation messages\n could be truncated, possibly leading to certain algorithms and features\n being downgraded. This issue is known as the Terrapin attack. This update\n adds protocol extensions to mitigate this issue. (CVE-2023-48795)\n\n It was discovered that OpenSSH incorrectly handled user names or host names\n with shell metacharacters. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\n perform OS command injection. This only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2023-51385)\n",
