  "details": "Andy Boothe discovered that the Networking component of OpenJDK 8 did not\nproperly handle access under certain circumstances. An unauthenticated \nattacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. \n(CVE-2024-21208)\n\nIt was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 did not properly\nhandle vectorization under certain circumstances. An unauthenticated \nattacker could possibly use this issue to access unauthorized resources \nand expose sensitive information. (CVE-2024-21210, CVE-2024-21235)\n\nIt was discovered that the Serialization component of OpenJDK 8 did not \nproperly handle deserialization under certain circumstances. An \nunauthenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial\nof service. (CVE-2024-21217)\n\nIt was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 was not properly\nbounding certain UTF-8 strings, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

(CVE-2024-21011)\n\nVladimir Kondratyev discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8\nincorrectly handled address offset calculations in the C1 compiler. An\nattacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service\nor execute arbitrary code. This issue was only addressed in Ubuntu\n16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-21068)\n\nYakov Shafranovich discovered that OpenJDK 8 did not properly manage\nmemory in the Pack200 archive format. An attacker could possibly use this\nissue to cause a denial of service. This issue was only addressed in Ubuntu\n16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-21085)\n\nIt was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 incorrectly\nhandled array accesses in the C2 compiler. An attacker could possibly use\nthis issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. This\nissue was only addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-21094)\n\nYi Yang discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 incorrectly\nhandled array accesses in the C1 compiler. An attacker could possibly\nuse this issue to cause a denial of service, execute arbitrary code or\nbypass Java sandbox restrictions. This issue was only addressed in Ubuntu\n16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-20918)\n\nIt was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 did not\nproperly verify bytecode in certain situations. An attacker could\npossibly use this issue to bypass Java sandbox restrictions. This \nissue was only addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-20919)\n\nIt was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK 8 had an\noptimization flaw when generating range check loop predicates. An attacker\ncould possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service, execute\narbitrary code or bypass Java sandbox restrictions. This issue was only \naddressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-20921)\n\nValentin Eudeline discovered that OpenJDK 8 incorrectly handled certain\noptions in the Nashorn JavaScript subcomponent. An attacker could\npossibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code. This issue was only \naddressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-20926)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenJDK 8 could produce debug logs that contained\nprivate keys used for digital signatures. An attacker could possibly use\nthis issue to obtain sensitive information. This issue was only addressed\nin Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-20945)\n\nHubert Kario discovered that the TLS implementation in OpenJDK 8 had a\ntiming side-channel and incorrectly handled RSA padding. A remote attacker\ncould possibly use this issue to recover sensitive information. This \nissue was only addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-20952)\n",
