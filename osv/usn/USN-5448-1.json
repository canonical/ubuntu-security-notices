  "details": "It was discovered that ncurses was not properly checking array bounds\nwhen executing the fmt_entry function, which could result in an\nout-of-bounds write. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-10684)\n\nIt was discovered that ncurses was not properly checking user input,\nwhich could result in it being treated as a format argument. An\nattacker could possibly use this issue to expose sensitive\ninformation or to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-10685)\n\nIt was discovered that ncurses was incorrectly performing memory\nmanagement operations and was not blocking access attempts to\nillegal memory locations. An attacker could possibly use this issue\nto cause a denial of service.

An\nattacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2017-11113)\n\nIt was discovered that ncurses was incorrectly handling loops in\nlibtic, which could lead to the execution of an infinite loop.
