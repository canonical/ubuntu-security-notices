  "summary": "linux vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the Bluetooth stack of\nthe Linux kernel when handling L2CAP configuration responses. A physically\nproximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2017-1000251)\n\nIt was discovered that the asynchronous I/O (aio) subsystem of the Linux\nkernel did not properly set permissions on aio memory mappings in some\nsituations. An attacker could use this to more easily exploit other\nvulnerabilities. (CVE-2016-10044)\n\nBaozeng Ding and Andrey Konovalov discovered a race condition in the L2TPv3\nIP Encapsulation implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2016-10200)\n\nAndreas Gruenbacher and Jan Kara discovered that the filesystem\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not clear the setgid bit during a\nsetxattr call. A local attacker could use this to possibly elevate group\nprivileges. (CVE-2016-7097)\n\nSergej Schumilo, Ralf Spenneberg, and Hendrik Schwartke discovered that the\nkey management subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly allocate\nmemory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-8650)\n\nVlad Tsyrklevich discovered an integer overflow vulnerability in the VFIO\nPCI driver for the Linux kernel. A local attacker with access to a vfio PCI\ndevice file could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-9083, CVE-2016-9084)\n\nIt was discovered that an information leak existed in __get_user_asm_ex()\nin the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2016-9178)\n\nCAI Qian discovered that the sysctl implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly perform reference counting in some situations. An unprivileged\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system hang).\n(CVE-2016-9191)\n\nIt was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel in\nsome situations did not prevent special internal keyrings from being joined\nby userspace keyrings. A privileged local attacker could use this to bypass\nmodule verification. (CVE-2016-9604)\n\nIt was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the trace subsystem\nof the Linux kernel. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-9754)\n\nAndrey Konovalov discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle invalid IP options in some situations. An\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2017-5970)\n\nDmitry Vyukov discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly handle TCP\npackets with the URG flag. A remote attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2017-6214)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the AF_PACKET handling\ncode in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2017-6346)\n\nIt was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly restrict searches for dead keys. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-6951)\n\nDmitry Vyukov discovered that the generic SCSI (sg) subsystem in the Linux\nkernel contained a stack-based buffer overflow. A local attacker with\naccess to an sg device could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-7187)\n\nEric Biggers discovered a memory leak in the keyring implementation in the\nLinux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(memory consumption). (CVE-2017-7472)\n\nIt was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the Broadcom FullMAC\nWLAN driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2017-7541)\n",
