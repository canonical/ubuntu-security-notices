  "details": "Hadar Manor discovered that the DCCP protocol implementation in the Linux\nkernel improperly handled socket reuse, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-16119)\n\nGiuseppe Scrivano discovered that the overlay file system in the Linux\nkernel did not properly perform permission checks in some situations. A\nlocal attacker could possibly use this to bypass intended restrictions and\ngain read access to restricted files. (CVE-2020-16120)\n",
