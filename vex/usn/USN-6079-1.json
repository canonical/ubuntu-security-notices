                "description": "It was discovered that some AMD x86-64 processors with SMT enabled could speculatively execute instructions using a return address from a sibling thread. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-27672)  Ziming Zhang discovered that the VMware Virtual GPU DRM driver in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-36280)  Zheng Wang discovered that the Intel i915 graphics driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a double-free. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3707)  Haowei Yan discovered that a race condition existed in the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-4129)  It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained a null pointer dereference in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-4842)  It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate attributes in certain situations, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-48423)  It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate attributes in certain situations, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-48424)  It was discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate buffer lengths, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1078)  Xingyuan Mo discovered that the x86 KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize some data structures. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-1513)  It was discovered that the NFS implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle pending tasks in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-1652)  It was discovered that the ARM64 EFI runtime services implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly manage concurrency calls. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-21102)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in Adreno GPU DRM driver in the Linux kernel, leading to a double-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-21106)  It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the iSCSI TCP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-23455)  It was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the size of attributes when parsing MFT. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-26544)  It was discovered that the NET/ROM protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in some situations, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-32269)  Duoming Zhou discovered that a race condition existed in the infrared receiver/transceiver driver in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after- free vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-1118)",
