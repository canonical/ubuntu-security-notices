  "details": "It was discovered that Chromium could be made to write out of bounds in\nseveral components. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to\ncorrupt memory via a crafted HTML page, resulting in a denial of service,\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-0930, CVE-2023-1219,\nCVE-2023-1220, CVE-2023-1222)\n\nIt was discovered that Chromium contained an integer overflow in the PDF\ncomponent. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to corrupt\nmemory via a crafted PDF file, resulting in a denial of service, or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-0933)\n\nIt was discovered that Chromium did not properly manage memory in several\ncomponents. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to corrupt\nmemory via a crafted HTML page, resulting in a denial of service, or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-0941, CVE-2023-0928,\nCVE-2023-0929, CVE-2023-0931, CVE-2023-1213, CVE-2023-1216, CVE-2023-1218)\n\nIt was discovered that Chromium did not correctly distinguish data types\nin several components. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to\ncorrupt memory via a crafted HTML page, resulting in a denial of service,\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-1214, CVE-2023-1215,\nCVE-2023-1235)\n\nIt was discovered that Chromium insufficiently enforced policies. An\nattacker could possibly use this issue to bypass navigation restrictions.\n(CVE-2023-1221, CVE-2023-1224)\n\nIt was discovered that Chromium insufficiently enforced policies in Web\nPayments API. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass\ncontent security policy via a crafted HTML page. (CVE-2023-1226)\n\nIt was discovered that Chromium contained an inappropriate implementation\nin the Permission prompts component. A remote attacker could possibly use\nthis issue to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n(CVE-2023-1229)\n\nIt was discovered that Chromium insufficiently enforced policies in\nResource Timing component. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue\nto obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2023-1232, CVE-2023-1233)\n\nIt was discovered that Chromium contained an inappropriate implementation\nin the Internals component. A remote attacker could possibly use this\nissue to spoof the origin of an iframe via a crafted HTML page.\n(CVE-2023-1236)\n",
