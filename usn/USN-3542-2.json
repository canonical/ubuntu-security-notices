This update provides the corresponding updates for the\nLinux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for\nUbuntu 12.04 ESM.\n\nJann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative\nexecution and branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory reads via\nsidechannel attacks. This flaw is known as Spectre. A local attacker\ncould use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel\nmemory. This update provides mitigations for the i386 (CVE-2017-5753\nonly) and amd64 architectures.\n",

On i386 and amd64\narchitectures, the IBRS and IBPB features are required to enable the\nkernel mitigations. Ubuntu is working with Intel and AMD to provide\nfuture microcode updates that implement IBRS and IBPB as they are made\navailable. Ubuntu users with a processor from a different vendor should\ncontact the vendor to identify necessary firmware updates. Ubuntu\nwill provide corresponding QEMU updates in the future for users of\nself-hosted virtual environments in coordination with upstream QEMU.\nUbuntu users in cloud environments should contact the cloud provider\nto confirm that the hypervisor has been updated to expose the new\nCPU features to virtual machines.\n\nAfter a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to\napply the necessary changes.\n",
