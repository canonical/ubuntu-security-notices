  "details": "An out of bounds write was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in\nto opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\nexploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2016-1660)\n\nIt was discovered that Blink assumes that a frame which passes same-origin\nchecks is local in some cases. If a user were tricked in to opening a\nspecially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\ncause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2016-1661)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in the V8 bindings in Blink. If a user\nwere tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash,\nor execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-1663)\n\nIt was discovered that the JSGenericLowering class in V8 mishandles\ncomparison operators. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially\ncrafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain\nsensitive information. (CVE-2016-1665)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial\nof service via application crash or execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2016-1666)\n\nIt was discovered that the TreeScope::adoptIfNeeded function in Blink\ndoes not prevent script execution during node-adoption operations. If a\nuser were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker\ncould potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions.\n(CVE-2016-1667)\n\nIt was discovered that the forEachForBinding in the V8 bindings in Blink\nuses an improper creation context. If a user were tricked in to opening a\nspecially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\nbypass same origin restrictions. (CVE-2016-1668)\n\nA buffer overflow was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2016-1669)\n\nA race condition was discovered in ResourceDispatcherHostImpl in Chromium.\nAn attacker could potentially exploit this to make arbitrary HTTP\nrequests. (CVE-2016-1670)\n",
