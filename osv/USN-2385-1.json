  "details": "It was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when parsing\nDTLS SRTP extension data. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue\nto cause OpenSSL to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service.\nThis issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\n(CVE-2014-3513)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when verifying\nthe integrity of a session ticket. A remote attacker could possibly use\nthis issue to cause OpenSSL to consume resources, resulting in a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2014-3567)\n\nIn addition, this update introduces support for the TLS Fallback Signaling\nCipher Suite Value (TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV). This new feature prevents protocol\ndowngrade attacks when certain applications such as web browsers attempt\nto reconnect using a lower protocol version for interoperability reasons.\n",
