An attacker could exploit this to expose sensitive data\nover the network or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-0402)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenJDK 7 incorrectly allowed MD5 to be used\nfor TLS connections. If a remote attacker were able to perform a\nmachine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2015-7575)\n\nA vulnerability was discovered in the OpenJDK JRE related to\ninformation disclosure. An attacker could exploit this to expose\nsensitive data over the network.
