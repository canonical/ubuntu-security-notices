  "details": "Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the key management subsystem in the Linux\nkernel did not properly restrict adding a key that already exists but is\nnegatively instantiated. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2015-8539)\n\nIt was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the device\ndriver for XCeive xc2028/xc3028 tuners in the Linux kernel. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-7913)\n\nPengfei Ding (\u4e01\u9e4f\u98de), Chenfu Bao (\u5305\u6c89\u6d6e), and Lenx Wei (\u97e6\u97ec)\ndiscovered a race condition in the generic SCSI driver (sg) of the Linux\nkernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-0794)\n\nEric Biggers discovered that the key management subsystem in the Linux\nkernel did not properly restrict adding a key that already exists but is\nuninstantiated. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-15299)\n\nIt was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference could be triggered in the\nOCFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2017-18216)\n\nLuo Quan and Wei Yang discovered that a race condition existed in the\nAdvanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem of the Linux kernel when\nhandling ioctl()s. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system deadlock). (CVE-2018-1000004)\n\n\u8303\u9f99\u98de discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced Linux\nSound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem of the Linux kernel that could lead to\na use- after-free or an out-of-bounds buffer access. A local attacker with\naccess to /dev/snd/seq could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-7566)\n\nIt was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the NFC Logical Link\nControl Protocol (llcp) implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-9518)\n",
