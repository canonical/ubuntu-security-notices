A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2017-7261)\n\nLi Qiang discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the\nDirect Rendering Manager (DRM) driver for VMWare devices in the Linux\nkernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-7294)\n\nIt was discovered that an information leak existed in the set_mempolicy and\nmbind compat syscalls in the Linux kernel.
