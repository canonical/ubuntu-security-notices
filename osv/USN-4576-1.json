  "details": "Hadar Manor discovered that the DCCP protocol implementation in the Linux\nkernel improperly handled socket reuse, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-16119)\n\nJay Shin discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle directory access with broken indexing,\nleading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-14314)\n\nDavid Alan Gilbert discovered that the XFS file system implementation in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly perform metadata validation in some\ncircumstances. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2020-14385)\n\nGiuseppe Scrivano discovered that the overlay file system in the Linux\nkernel did not properly perform permission checks in some situations. A\nlocal attacker could possibly use this to bypass intended restrictions and\ngain read access to restricted files. (CVE-2020-16120)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the hugetlb sysctl\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A privileged attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-25285)\n\nIt was discovered that the block layer subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle zero-length requests. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service.
