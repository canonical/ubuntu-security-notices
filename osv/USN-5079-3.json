  "details": "USN-5079-1 fixed vulnerabilities in curl. One of the fixes introduced a\nregression on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. This update fixes the problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that curl incorrect handled memory when sending data to\n an MQTT server. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause curl to\n crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary\n code. (CVE-2021-22945)\n \n Patrick Monnerat discovered that curl incorrectly handled upgrades to TLS.\n When receiving certain responses from servers, curl would continue without\n TLS even when the option to require a successful upgrade to TLS was\n specified. (CVE-2021-22946)\n \n Patrick Monnerat discovered that curl incorrectly handled responses\n received before STARTTLS. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue\n to inject responses and intercept communications. (CVE-2021-22947)\n",
