  "description": "USN-5402-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in OpenSSL. This update provides\nthe corresponding update for Ubuntu 16.04 ESM.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Elison Niven discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled the c_rehash\n script. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary\n commands when c_rehash is run. (CVE-2022-1292)\n \n Aliaksei Levin discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled resources when\n decoding certificates and keys. A remote attacker could possibly use this\n issue to cause OpenSSL to consume resources, leading to a denial of\n service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-1473)\n",
