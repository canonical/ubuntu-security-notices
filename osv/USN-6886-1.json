  "details": "It was discovered that the Go net/http module did not properly handle the\nrequests when request\\'s headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes. An attacker could\npossibly use this issue to cause a panic resulting into a denial of service.\nThis issue only affected Go 1.21 in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.\n(CVE-2023-45288)\n\nIt was discovered that the Go net/http module did not properly validate the\nsubdomain match or exact match of the initial domain. An attacker could\npossibly use this issue to read sensitive information. This issue only\naffected Go 1.21 in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2023-45289)\n\nIt was discovered that the Go net/http module did not properly validate the\ntotal size of the parsed form when parsing a multipart form. An attacker\ncould possibly use this issue to cause a panic resulting into a denial of\nservice. This issue only affected Go 1.21 in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu\n22.04 LTS. (CVE-2023-45290)\n\nIt was discovered that the Go crypto/x509 module did not properly handle a\ncertificate chain which contains a certificate with an unknown public key\nalgorithm. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a panic\nresulting into a denial of service. This issue only affected Go 1.21 in\nUbuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-24783)\n\nIt was discovered that the Go net/mail module did not properly handle\ncomments within display names in the ParseAddressList function. An\nattacker could possibly use this issue to cause a panic resulting into a\ndenial of service. This issue only affected Go 1.21 in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and\nUbuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-24784)\n\nIt was discovered that the Go html/template module did not validate errors\nreturned from MarshalJSON methods. An attacker could possibly use this\nissue to inject arbitrary code into the Go template. This issue only\naffected Go 1.21 in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-24785)\n\nIt was discovered that the Go net module did not properly validate the DNS\nmessage in response to a query. An attacker could possibly use this issue\nto cause a panic resulting into a denial of service. This issue only\naffected Go 1.22. (CVE-2024-24788)\n\nIt was discovered that the Go archive/zip module did not properly handle\ncertain types of invalid zip files differs from the behavior of most zip\nimplementations. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a panic\nresulting into a denial of service. (CVE-2024-24789)\n\nIt was discovered that the Go net/netip module did not work as expected\nfor IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses in various Is methods. An attacker could\npossibly use this issue to cause a panic resulting into a denial of service.\n(CVE-2024-24790)\n",
