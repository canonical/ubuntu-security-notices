  "details": "Timothy Michaud discovered that the i915 graphics driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate user memory locations for the\ni915_gem_execbuffer2_ioctl. A local attacker could possibly use this to\ncause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-20669)\n\nIt was discovered that the Kvaser CAN/USB driver in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly initialize memory in certain situations. A local attacker\ncould possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2019-19947)\n\nChuhong Yuan discovered that go7007 USB audio device driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly deallocate memory in some failure conditions. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-20810)\n\nIt was discovered that the elf handling code in the Linux kernel did not\ninitialize memory before using it in certain situations. A local attacker\ncould use this to possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2020-10732)\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel did not correctly apply Speculative\nStore Bypass Disable (SSBD) mitigations in certain situations. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2020-10766)\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel did not correctly apply Indirect\nBranch Predictor Barrier (IBPB) mitigations in certain situations. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2020-10767)\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel could incorrectly enable Indirect\nBranch Speculation after it has been disabled for a process via a prctl()\ncall. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2020-10768)\n\nLuca Bruno discovered that the zram module in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly restrict unprivileged users from accessing the hot_add sysfs file.\nA local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory\nexhaustion). (CVE-2020-10781)\n\nIt was discovered that the XFS file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate meta data in some circumstances. An\nattacker could use this to construct a malicious XFS image that, when\nmounted, could cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-12655)\n\nIt was discovered that the bcache subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly release a lock in some error conditions. A local attacker could\npossibly use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-12771)\n\nIt was discovered that the Virtual Terminal keyboard driver in the Linux\nkernel contained an integer overflow. A local attacker could possibly use\nthis to have an unspecified impact. (CVE-2020-13974)\n\nKyungtae Kim discovered that the USB testing driver in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly deallocate memory on disconnect events. A physically proximate\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2020-15393)\n\nIt was discovered that the NFS server implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly honor umask settings when setting permissions while\ncreating file system objects if the underlying file system did not support\nACLs. An attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information\nor violate system integrity. (CVE-2020-24394)\n\nIt was discovered that the Kerberos SUNRPC GSS implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly deallocate memory on module unload. A local\nprivileged attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service\n(memory exhaustion). (CVE-2020-12656)\n",
