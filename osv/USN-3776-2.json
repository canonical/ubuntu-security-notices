  "details": "USN-3776-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04\nLTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux\nHardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu\n14.04 LTS.\n\nJann Horn discovered that the vmacache subsystem did not properly handle\nsequence number overflows, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-17182)\n\nIt was discovered that the paravirtualization implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle some indirect calls, reducing the\neffectiveness of Spectre v2 mitigations for paravirtual guests. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-15594)\n\nIt was discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and\nprediction of return addresses via Return Stack Buffer (RSB) may allow\nunauthorized memory reads via sidechannel attacks. An attacker could use\nthis to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-15572)\n\nIt was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference could be triggered in the\nOCFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2017-18216)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the raw MIDI driver for\nthe Linux kernel, leading to a double free vulnerability. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-10902)\n\nIt was discovered that a stack-based buffer overflow existed in the iSCSI\ntarget implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-14633)\n\nIt was discovered that the YUREX USB device driver for the Linux kernel did\nnot properly restrict user space reads or writes. A physically proximate\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-16276)\n\nIt was discovered that a memory leak existed in the IRDA subsystem of the\nLinux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2018-6554)\n\nIt was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the IRDA\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2018-6555)\n",
