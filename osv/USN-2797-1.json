  "summary": "linux-lts-utopic vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not check if a new IPv6 MTU set\nby a user space application was valid. A remote attacker could forge a\nroute advertisement with an invalid MTU that a user space daemon like\nNetworkManager would honor and apply to the kernel, causing a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2015-0272)\n\nIt was discovered that in certain situations, a directory could be renamed\noutside of a bind mounted location. An attacker could use this to escape\nbind mount containment and gain access to sensitive information.\n(CVE-2015-2925)\n\nMoein Ghasemzadeh discovered that the USB WhiteHEAT serial driver contained\nhardcoded attributes about the USB devices. An attacker could construct a\nfake WhiteHEAT USB device that, when inserted, causes a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2015-5257)\n\nIt was discovered that the SCTP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel\nperformed an incorrect sequence of protocol-initialization steps. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2015-5283)\n",
