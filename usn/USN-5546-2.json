  "description": "USN-5546-1 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenJDK.\nThis update provides the corresponding updates for Ubuntu 16.04 ESM.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Neil Madden discovered that OpenJDK did not properly verify ECDSA\n signatures. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to insert,\n edit or obtain sensitive information. This issue only affected OpenJDK\n 17 and OpenJDK 18. (CVE-2022-21449)\n\n It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly limited memory when compiling a\n specially crafted XPath expression. An attacker could possibly use this\n issue to cause a denial of service. This issue was fixed in OpenJDK 8 and\n OpenJDK 18. USN-5388-1 and USN-5388-2 addressed this issue in OpenJDK 11\n and OpenJDK 17. (CVE-2022-21426)\n\n It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled converting certain\n object arguments into their textual representations. An attacker could\n possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue was\n fixed in OpenJDK 8 and OpenJDK 18. USN-5388-1 and USN-5388-2 addressed\n this issue in OpenJDK 11 and OpenJDK 17. (CVE-2022-21434)\n\n It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly validated the encoded length of\n certain object identifiers. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\n cause a denial of service. This issue was fixed in OpenJDK 8 and OpenJDK 18.\n USN-5388-1 and USN-5388-2 addressed this issue in OpenJDK 11 and OpenJDK 17.\n (CVE-2022-21443)\n\n It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly validated certain paths. An\n attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass the secure validation\n feature and expose sensitive information in XML files. This issue was\n fixed in OpenJDK 8 and OpenJDK 18. USN-5388-1 and USN-5388-2 addressed this\n issue in OpenJDK 11 and OpenJDK 17. (CVE-2022-21476)\n\n It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly parsed certain URI strings. An\n attacker could possibly use this issue to make applications accept\n invalid of malformed URI strings. This issue was fixed in OpenJDK 8 and\n OpenJDK 18. USN-5388-1 and USN-5388-2 addressed this issue in OpenJDK 11\n and OpenJDK 17. (CVE-2022-21496)\n\n It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly generated class code in the\n Hotspot component. An attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain\n sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21540)\n\n It was dicovered that OpenJDK incorrectly restricted access to the\n invokeBasic() method in the Hotspot component. An attacker could possibly\n use this issue to insert, edit or obtain sensitive information.\n (CVE-2022-21541)\n\n It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly computed exponentials. An\n attacker could possibly use this issue to insert, edit or obtain sensitive\n information. This issue only affected OpenJDK 17.\n (CVE-2022-21549)\n\n It was discovered that OpenJDK includes a copy of Xalan that incorrectly\n handled integer truncation. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\n execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-34169)\n",
