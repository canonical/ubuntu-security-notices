  "details": "USN-5523-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in LibTIFF. This update\nprovides the fixes for CVE-2022-0907, CVE-2022-0908, CVE-2022-0909,\nCVE-2022-0924 and CVE-2022-22844 for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and\nUbuntu 20.04 LTS.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly perf   orming checks to\n guarantee that allocated memory space existed, which could lead to a\n NULL pointer dereference via a specially crafted file. An attacker\n could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.\n (CVE-2022-0907, CVE-2022-0908)\n \n It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing checks to\n avoid division calculations where the denominator value was zero,\n which could lead to an undefined behavior situation via a specially\n crafted file. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a\n denial of service. (CVE-2022-0909)\n \n It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing bounds\n checks, which could lead to an out-of-bounds read via a specially\n crafted file. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a\n denial of service or to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-0924)\n \n It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing the\n calculation of data that would eventually be used as a reference for\n bounds checking operations, which could lead to an out-of-bounds\n read via a specially crafted file. An attacker could possibly use\n this issue to cause a denial of service or to expose sensitive\n information. (CVE-2020-19131)\n \n It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly terminating a\n function execution when processing incorrect data, which could lead\n to an out-of-bounds read via a specially crafted file. An attacker\n could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or to\n expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-19144)\n \n It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing checks\n when setting the value for data later used as reference during memory\n access, which could lead to an out-of-bounds read via a specially\n crafted file. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a\n denial of service or to expose sensitive information.\n (CVE-2022-22844)\n",
