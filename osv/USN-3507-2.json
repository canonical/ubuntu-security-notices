  "details": "Mohamed Ghannam discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in\nthe Netlink subsystem (XFRM) in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2017-16939)\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly handle copy-on-\nwrite of transparent huge pages. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (application crashes) or possibly gain administrative\nprivileges. (CVE-2017-1000405)\n\nFan Wu, Haoran Qiu, and Shixiong Zhao discovered that the associative array\nimplementation in the Linux kernel sometimes did not properly handle adding\na new entry. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2017-12193)\n\nEric Biggers discovered that the key management subsystem in the Linux\nkernel did not properly restrict adding a key that already exists but is\nuninstantiated. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-15299)\n\nIt was discovered that a null pointer dereference error existed in the\nPowerPC KVM implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-15306)\n\nEric Biggers discovered a race condition in the key management subsystem of\nthe Linux kernel around keys in a negative state. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2017-15951)\n",
