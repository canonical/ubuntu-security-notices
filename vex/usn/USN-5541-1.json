                "description": "Eric Biederman discovered that the cgroup process migration implementation in the Linux kernel did not perform permission checks correctly in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2021-4197)  Jann Horn discovered that the FUSE file system in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1011)  Duoming Zhou discovered that the 6pack protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not handle detach events properly in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-1198)  Duoming Zhou discovered that the AX.25 amateur radio protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not handle detach events properly in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1199)  Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the AX.25 amateur radio protocol implementation in the Linux kernel during device detach operations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-1204)  Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the AX.25 amateur radio protocol implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-1205)  It was discovered that the PF_KEYv2 implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize kernel memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-1353)  It was discovered that the implementation of X.25 network protocols in the Linux kernel did not terminate link layer sessions properly. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-1516)  Zheyu Ma discovered that the Silicon Motion SM712 framebuffer driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle very small reads. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-2380)  It was discovered that the 8 Devices USB2CAN interface implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a double-free. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-28388)  It was discovered that the Microchip CAN BUS Analyzer interface implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a double-free. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-28389)",
