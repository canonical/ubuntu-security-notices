  "details": "hyper is an HTTP library for rust. hyper's HTTP/1 server code had a flaw that incorrectly parses and accepts requests with a `Content-Length` header with a prefixed plus sign, when it should have been rejected as illegal. This combined with an upstream HTTP proxy that doesn't parse such `Content-Length` headers, but forwards them, can result in \"request smuggling\" or \"desync attacks\". The flaw exists in all prior versions of hyper prior to 0.14.10, if built with `rustc` v1.5.0 or newer. The vulnerability is patched in hyper version 0.14.10. Two workarounds exist: One may reject requests manually that contain a plus sign prefix in the `Content-Length` header or ensure any upstream proxy handles `Content-Length` headers with a plus sign prefix.",
