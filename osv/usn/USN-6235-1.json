  "details": "\nIt was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel contained a null pointer dereference in some situations. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2022-4842)\n\nJordy Zomer and Alexandra Sandulescu discovered that the Linux kernel did\nnot properly implement speculative execution barriers in usercopy functions\nin certain situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-0459)\n\nSeth Jenkins discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly perform\naddress randomization for a per-cpu memory management structure. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory)\nor in conjunction with another kernel vulnerability. (CVE-2023-0597)\n\nIt was discovered that the Human Interface Device (HID) support driver in\nthe Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some\nsituations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2023-1073)\n\nIt was discovered that the XFS file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly perform metadata validation when mounting certain\nimages. An attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image\nthat, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-2124)\n\nWei Chen discovered that the InfiniBand RDMA communication manager\nimplementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds read\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2023-2176)\n\nXingyuan Mo and Gengjia Chen discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle locking when IOPOLL mode is being\nused. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2023-2430)\n\nHangyu Hua discovered that the Flower classifier implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. An attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-35788, LP: #2023577)\n\nIt was discovered that for some Intel processors the INVLPG instruction\nimplementation did not properly flush global TLB entries when PCIDs are\nenabled. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information\n(kernel memory) or possibly cause undesired behaviors. (LP: #2023220)\n\n",
