A remote attacker could possibly\nuse this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected\nUbuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2016-2774)\n\nIt was discovered that the DHCP server incorrectly handled socket\ndescriptors. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2017-3144)\n\nFelix Wilhelm discovered that the DHCP client incorrectly handled certain\nmalformed responses. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the\nDHCP client to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute\narbitrary code. In the default installation, attackers would be isolated by\nthe dhclient AppArmor profile. (CVE-2018-5732)\n\nFelix Wilhelm discovered that the DHCP server incorrectly handled reference\ncounting.
