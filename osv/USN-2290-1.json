  "details": "\nSasha Levin reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's point-to-point protocol\n(PPP) when used with the Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP). A local user\ncould exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2014-4943)\n\nSalva Peir\u00f3 discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's media-\ndevice driver. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive\ninformation from kernel memory. (CVE-2014-1739)\n\nA bounds check error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem of the\nLinux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. (CVE-2014-3144)\n\nA remainder calculation error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem\nof the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. (CVE-2014-3145)\n\nA flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's handling of hugetlb entries. A\nlocal user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial service (memory\ncorruption or system crash). (CVE-2014-3940)\n\nDon Bailey and Ludvig Strigeus discovered an integer overflow in the Linux\nkernel's implementation of the LZ4 decompression algorithm, when used by\ncode not complying with API limitations. An attacker could exploit this\nflaw to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly other\nunspecified impact. (CVE-2014-4611)\n\nTuomas R\u00e4s\u00e4nen reported the Linux kernel on certain Intel processors does\nnot properly initialize random seeds for network operations, causing TCP\nsequence numbers, TCP and UDP port numbers and IP ID values to be\npredictable. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to spoof or disrupt\nIP communication. (CVE-2014-7284)\n",
