  "details": "Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the CAN BCM networking\nprotocol of the Linux kernel leading to multiple use-after-free\nvulnerabilities. A local attacker could use this issue to execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2021-3609)\n\nPiotr Krysiuk discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly enforce limits for pointer operations. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-33200)\n\nMathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel\u2019s WiFi implementation did\nnot properly clear received fragments from memory in some situations. A\nphysically proximate attacker could possibly use this issue to inject\npackets or expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-24586)\n\nMathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel\u2019s WiFi implementation\nincorrectly handled encrypted fragments. A physically proximate attacker\ncould possibly use this issue to decrypt fragments. (CVE-2020-24587)\n\nMathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel\u2019s WiFi implementation\nincorrectly handled certain malformed frames. If a user were tricked into\nconnecting to a malicious server, a physically proximate attacker could use\nthis issue to inject packets. (CVE-2020-24588)\n\nKiyin (\u5c39\u4eae) discovered that the NFC LLCP protocol implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a reference counting error. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-25670)\n\nKiyin (\u5c39\u4eae) discovered that the NFC LLCP protocol implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error\nsituations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(memory exhaustion). (CVE-2020-25671, CVE-2020-25672)\n\nKiyin (\u5c39\u4eae) discovered that the NFC LLCP protocol implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle error conditions in some situations,\nleading to an infinite loop. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2020-25673)\n\nMathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel\u2019s WiFi implementation\nincorrectly handled EAPOL frames from unauthenticated senders. A physically\nproximate attacker could inject malicious packets to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2020-26139)\n\nMathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel\u2019s WiFi implementation did\nnot properly verify certain fragmented frames. A physically proximate\nattacker could possibly use this issue to inject or decrypt packets.\n(CVE-2020-26141)\n\nMathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel\u2019s WiFi implementation\naccepted plaintext fragments in certain situations. A physically proximate\n attacker could use this issue to inject packets. (CVE-2020-26145)\n\nMathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel\u2019s WiFi implementation could\nreassemble mixed encrypted and plaintext fragments. A physically proximate\nattacker could possibly use this issue to inject packets or exfiltrate\n selected fragments. (CVE-2020-26147)\n\nOr Cohen discovered that the SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel\ncontained a race condition in some situations, leading to a use-after-free\ncondition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-23133)\n\nPiotr Krysiuk and Benedict Schlueter discovered that the eBPF\nimplementation in the Linux kernel performed out of bounds speculation on\npointer arithmetic. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2021-29155)\n\nManfred Paul discovered that the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF)\nimplementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this issue to execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2021-31440)\n\nPiotr Krysiuk discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly prevent speculative loads in certain situations. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2021-31829)\n",
