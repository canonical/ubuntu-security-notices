  "summary": "openssl, openssl1.0 vulnerabilities",
  "details": "Robert Merget, Marcus Brinkmann, Nimrod Aviram, and Juraj Somorovsky\ndiscovered that certain Diffie-Hellman ciphersuites in the TLS\nspecification and implemented by OpenSSL contained a flaw. A remote\nattacker could possibly use this issue to eavesdrop on encrypted\ncommunications. This was fixed in this update by removing the insecure\nciphersuites from OpenSSL. (CVE-2020-1968)\n\nCesar Pereida Garc\u00eda, Sohaib ul Hassan, Nicola Tuveri, Iaroslav Gridin,\nAlejandro Cabrera Aldaya, and Billy Brumley discovered that OpenSSL\nincorrectly handled ECDSA signatures. An attacker could possibly use this\nissue to perform a timing side-channel attack and recover private ECDSA\nkeys. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2019-1547)\n\nGuido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly performed the x86_64\nMontgomery squaring procedure. While unlikely, a remote attacker could\npossibly use this issue to recover private keys. This issue only affected\nUbuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2019-1551)\n\nBernd Edlinger discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain\ndecryption functions. In certain scenarios, a remote attacker could\npossibly use this issue to perform a padding oracle attack and decrypt\ntraffic. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2019-1563)\n\n",
