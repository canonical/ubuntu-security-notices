  "details": "Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the CAN BCM networking\nprotocol of the Linux kernel leading to multiple use-after-free\nvulnerabilities. A local attacker could use this issue to execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2021-3609)\n\nLikang Luo discovered that a race condition existed in the Bluetooth\nsubsystem of the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3752)\n\nIt was discovered that the NFC subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a\nuse-after-free vulnerability in its NFC Controller Interface (NCI)\nimplementation. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3760)\n\nSzymon Heidrich discovered that the USB Gadget subsystem in the Linux\nkernel did not properly restrict the size of control requests for certain\ngadget types, leading to possible out of bounds reads or writes. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-39685)\n\nIt was discovered that the Ion Memory Manager subsystem in the Linux kernel\ncontained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2021-39714)\n\nEric Biederman discovered that the cgroup process migration implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not perform permission checks correctly in some\nsituations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain administrative\nprivileges. (CVE-2021-4197)\n\nLin Ma discovered that the NFC Controller Interface (NCI) implementation in\nthe Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-4202)\n\nSushma Venkatesh Reddy discovered that the Intel i915 graphics driver in\nthe Linux kernel did not perform a GPU TLB flush in some situations. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-0330)\n\nIt was discovered that the PF_KEYv2 implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly initialize kernel memory in some situations. A local attacker\ncould use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2022-1353)\n\nIt was discovered that the virtual graphics memory manager implementation\nin the Linux kernel was subject to a race condition, potentially leading to\nan information leak. (CVE-2022-1419)\n\nMinh Yuan discovered that the floppy disk driver in the Linux kernel\ncontained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nlocal attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1652)\n\nIt was discovered that the Atheros ath9k wireless device driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle some error conditions, leading to a\nuse-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2022-1679)\n\nIt was discovered that the Marvell NFC device driver implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly perform memory cleanup operations in some\nsituations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker\ncould possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1734)\n\nIt was discovered that some Intel processors did not completely perform\ncleanup actions on multi-core shared buffers. A local attacker could\npossibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21123)\n\nIt was discovered that some Intel processors did not completely perform\ncleanup actions on microarchitectural fill buffers. A local attacker could\npossibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21125)\n\nIt was discovered that some Intel processors did not properly perform\ncleanup during specific special register write operations. A local attacker\ncould possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21166)\n\nIt was discovered that the USB Gadget file system interface in the Linux\nkernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2022-24958)\n\n\u8d75\u5b50\u8f69 discovered that the 802.2 LLC type 2 driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly perform reference counting in some error conditions. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-28356)\n\nIt was discovered that the 8 Devices USB2CAN interface implementation in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading\nto a double-free. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-28388)\n",
