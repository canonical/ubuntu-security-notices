  "details": "Justin Yackoski discovered that the Atheros L2 Ethernet Driver in the Linux\nkernel incorrectly enables scatter/gather I/O. A remote attacker could use\nthis to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.\n(CVE-2016-2117)\n\nJann Horn discovered that eCryptfs improperly attempted to use the mmap()\nhandler of a lower filesystem that did not implement one, causing a\nrecursive page fault to occur. A local unprivileged attacker could use to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code\nwith administrative privileges. (CVE-2016-1583)\n\nMultiple race conditions where discovered in the Linux kernel's ext4 file\nsystem. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service\n(disk corruption) by writing to a page that is associated with a different\nusers file after unsynchronized hole punching and page-fault handling.\n(CVE-2015-8839)\n\nRalf Spenneberg discovered that the Linux kernel's GTCO digitizer USB\ndevice driver did not properly validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker\nwith physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2016-2187)\n\nVitaly Kuznetsov discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly suppress\nhugetlbfs support in X86 paravirtualized guests. An attacker in the guest\nOS could cause a denial of service (guest system crash). (CVE-2016-3961)\n\nKangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2\nSupport implementations in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use\nthis to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.\n(CVE-2016-4485)\n\nKangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the routing netlink socket\ninterface (rtnetlink) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker\ncould use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel\nmemory. (CVE-2016-4486)\n\nJann Horn discovered that the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF)\nimplementation in the Linux kernel could overflow reference counters on\nsystems with more than 32GB of physical ram and with RLIMIT_MEMLOCK set to\ninfinite. A local unprivileged attacker could use to create a use-after-\nfree situation, causing a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain\nadministrative privileges. (CVE-2016-4558)\n\nJann Horn discovered that the InfiniBand interfaces within the Linux kernel\ncould be coerced into overwriting kernel memory. A local unprivileged\nattacker could use this to possibly gain administrative privileges on\nsystems where InifiniBand related kernel modules are loaded.\n(CVE-2016-4565)\n\nIt was discovered that in some situations the Linux kernel did not handle\npropagated mounts correctly. A local unprivileged attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-4581)\n",
