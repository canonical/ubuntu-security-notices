If a user or automated system were tricked into\nsending a specially crafted multipart POST request to an application using\nRack, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2022-30122)\n\nIt was discovered that Rack was not properly escaping untrusted data when\nperforming logging operations, which could cause shell escaped sequences\nto be written to a terminal. If a user or automated system were tricked\ninto sending a specially crafted request to an application using Rack, a\nremote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code in\nthe machine running the application. (CVE-2022-30123)\n\nIt was discovered that Rack did not properly structure regular expressions\nin some of its parsing components, which could result in uncontrolled\nresource consumption if an application using Rack received specially\ncrafted input.
