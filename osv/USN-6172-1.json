(CVE-2023-1076)\n\nIt was discovered that the Real-Time Scheduling Class implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability in some situations. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-1077)\n\nIt was discovered that the ASUS HID driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle device removal, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.\nA local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB\ndevice to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1079)\n\nIt was discovered that the Xircom PCMCIA network device driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle device removal events. A physically\nproximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2023-1670)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Xen transport layer\nimplementation for the 9P file system protocol in the Linux kernel, leading\nto a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause\na denial of service (guest crash) or expose sensitive information (guest\nkernel memory). (CVE-2023-1859)\n\nJose Oliveira and Rodrigo Branco discovered that the Spectre Variant 2\nmitigations with prctl syscall were insufficient in some situations. A\nlocal attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2023-1998)\n\nIt was discovered that the BigBen Interactive Kids' gamepad driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle device removal, leading to a use-\nafter-free vulnerability. A local attacker with physical access could plug\nin a specially crafted USB device to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash).
