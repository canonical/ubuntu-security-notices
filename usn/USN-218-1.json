  "description": "Two buffer overflows were discovered in the 'pnmtopng' tool, which\nwere triggered by processing an image with exactly 256 colors when\nusing the -alpha option (CVE-2005-3662) or by processing a text file\nwith very long lines when using the -text option (CVE-2005-3632).\n\nA remote attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary code by\ntricking an user or an automated system into processing a specially\ncrafted PNM file with pnmtopng.",
