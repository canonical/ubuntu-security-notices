Original advisory details:   Matthias Gerstner and J\u00e1n Tomko discovered that libvirt incorrectly handled  certain API calls. An attacker could possibly use this issue to check for  arbitrary files, or execute arbitrary binaries. In the default  installation, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor profile.",
