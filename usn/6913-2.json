  "description": "USN-6913-1 fixed CVE-2022-39369 for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.\nThis update provides the corresponding fix for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\nFilip Hejsek discovered that phpCAS was using HTTP headers to determine\nthe service URL used to validate tickets. A remote attacker could\npossibly use this issue to gain access to a victim's account on a\nvulnerable CASified service.\n\nThis security update introduces an incompatible API change. After applying\nthis update, third party applications need to be modified to pass in an\nadditional service base URL argument when constructing the client class.\n\nFor more information please refer to the section\n\"Upgrading 1.5.0 -> 1.6.0\" of the phpCAS upgrading document:\n\nhttps://github.com/apereo/phpCAS/blob/master/docs/Upgrading\n",
