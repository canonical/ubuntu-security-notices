  "details": "It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the 802.11 Wi-Fi\nconfiguration interface for the Linux kernel when handling beacon settings.\nA local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-16746)\n\nNicolas Waisman discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate SSID lengths. A physically proximate attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2019-17133)\n\nIt was discovered that the ADIS16400 IIO IMU Driver for the Linux kernel\ndid not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2019-19060)\n\nIt was discovered that the Intel OPA Gen1 Infiniband Driver for the Linux\nkernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory\nexhaustion). (CVE-2019-19065)\n\nIt was discovered that the Cascoda CA8210 SPI 802.15.4 wireless controller\ndriver for the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain\nerror conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19075)\n\nNicolas Waisman discovered that the Chelsio T4/T5 RDMA Driver for the Linux\nkernel performed DMA from a kernel stack. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-17075)\n",
