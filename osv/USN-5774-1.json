  "details": "Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly track memory\nallocations for anonymous VMA mappings in some situations, leading to\npotential data structure reuse. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2022-42703)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the instruction emulator\nof the Linux kernel on Arm 64-bit systems. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-20422)\n\nIt was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle virtual CPUs without APICs in certain situations. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host system\ncrash). (CVE-2022-2153)\n\nHao Sun and Jiacheng Xu discovered that the NILFS file system\nimplementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2978)\n\nAbhishek Shah discovered a race condition in the PF_KEYv2 implementation in\nthe Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel\nmemory). (CVE-2022-3028)\n\nIt was discovered that the video4linux driver for Empia based TV cards in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some\nsituations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3239)\n\nIt was discovered that a memory leak existed in the IPv6 implementation of\nthe Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2022-3524)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Bluetooth subsystem\nin the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3564)\n\nIt was discovered that the ISDN implementation of the Linux kernel\ncontained a use-after-free vulnerability. A privileged user could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2022-3565)\n\nIt was discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel contained\na data race condition. An attacker could possibly use this to cause\nundesired behaviors. (CVE-2022-3566)\n\nIt was discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel\ncontained a data race condition. An attacker could possibly use this to\ncause undesired behaviors. (CVE-2022-3567)\n\nIt was discovered that the Realtek RTL8152 USB Ethernet adapter driver in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions. A local\nattacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device\nto cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2022-3594)\n\nIt was discovered that a null pointer dereference existed in the NILFS2\nfile system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3621)\n\nIt was discovered that the IDT 77252 ATM PCI device driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly remove any pending timers during device exit,\nresulting in a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could\npossibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3635)\n\nIt was discovered that the Netlink Transformation (XFRM) subsystem in the\nLinux kernel contained a reference counting error. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-36879)\n\nXingyuan Mo and Gengjia Chen discovered that the Promise SuperTrak EX\nstorage controller driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle\ncertain structures. A local attacker could potentially use this to expose\nsensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-40768)\n\n",
