This update provides the corresponding updates for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS for CVE-2021-44118, CVE-2021-44120, CVE-2021-44122 and CVE-2021-44123.  Original advisory details:     It was discovered that SPIP incorrectly validated inputs. An authenticated  attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.  This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2020-28984)    Charles Fol and Th\u00e9o Gordyjan discovered that SPIP is vulnerable to Cross  Site Scripting (XSS). If a user were tricked into browsing a malicious SVG  file, an attacker could possibly exploit this issue to execute arbitrary  code. This issue was only fixed in Ubuntu 21.10. (CVE-2021-44118,  CVE-2021-44120, CVE-2021-44122, CVE-2021-44123)    It was discovered that SPIP incorrectly handled certain forms. A remote  authenticated editor could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code,  and a remote unauthenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain  sensitive information. (CVE-2022-26846, CVE-2022-26847)",
