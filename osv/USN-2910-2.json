  "details": "USN-2910-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Ubuntu 15.04 Linux kernel\nbackported to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. An incorrect locking fix caused a\nregression that broke graphics displays for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS guests\nrunning the Ubuntu 15.04 backport kernel within VMWare virtual\nmachines. This update fixes the problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n halfdog discovered that OverlayFS, when mounting on top of a FUSE mount,\n incorrectly propagated file attributes, including setuid. A local\n unprivileged attacker could use this to gain privileges. (CVE-2016-1576)\n\n halfdog discovered that OverlayFS in the Linux kernel incorrectly\n propagated security sensitive extended attributes, such as POSIX ACLs. A\n local unprivileged attacker could use this to gain privileges.\n (CVE-2016-1575)\n\n It was discovered that the Linux kernel keyring subsystem contained a race\n between read and revoke operations. A local attacker could use this to\n cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-7550)\n\n \u90ed\u6c38\u521a discovered that the Linux kernel networking implementation did\n not validate protocol identifiers for certain protocol families, A local\n attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\n possibly gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2015-8543)\n\n Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the pptp implementation in the Linux kernel\n did not verify an address length when setting up a socket. A local attacker\n could use this to craft an application that exposed sensitive information\n from kernel memory. (CVE-2015-8569)\n\n David Miller discovered that the Bluetooth implementation in the Linux\n kernel did not properly validate the socket address length for Synchronous\n Connection-Oriented (SCO) sockets. A local attacker could use this to\n expose sensitive information. (CVE-2015-8575)\n\n It was discovered that the Linux kernel's Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE)\n implementation did not handle initial zero length segments properly. A\n local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (unkillable\n task). (CVE-2015-8785)\n",
