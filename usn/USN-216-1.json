  "description": "Two integer overflows have been discovered in the XPM image loader of\nthe GDK pixbuf library. By tricking an user into opening a specially\ncrafted XPM image with any Gnome desktop application that uses this\nlibrary, this could be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user running the application.\n(CVE-2005-2976, CVE-2005-3186)\n\nAdditionally, specially crafted XPM images could cause an endless loop\nin the image loader, which could be exploited to cause applications\ntrying to open that image to hang. (CVE-2005-2975)",
