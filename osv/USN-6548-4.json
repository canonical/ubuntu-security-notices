  "summary": "linux-gkeop vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that Spectre-BHB mitigations were missing for Ampere\nprocessors. A local attacker could potentially use this to expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2023-3006)\n\nIt was discovered that the USB subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a\nrace condition while handling device descriptors in certain situations,\nleading to a out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could\npossibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-37453)\n\nLucas Leong discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly validate some attributes passed from userspace. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-39189)\n\nSunjoo Park discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly validate u32 packets content, leading to an out-of-bounds read\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-39192)\n\nLucas Leong discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly validate SCTP data, leading to an out-of-bounds read\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-39193)\n\nLucas Leong discovered that the Netlink Transformation (XFRM) subsystem in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly handle state filters, leading to an out-\nof-bounds read vulnerability. A privileged local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2023-39194)\n\nKyle Zeng discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle socket buffers (skb) when performing IP routing in\ncertain circumstances, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability.\nA privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2023-42754)\n\nAlon Zahavi discovered that the NVMe-oF/TCP subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly handle queue initialization failures in certain\nsituations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A remote attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-5178)\n\nBudimir Markovic discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle event groups, leading to an out-of-bounds write\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-5717)\n\nIt was discovered that the TLS subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly perform cryptographic operations in some situations, leading to a\nnull pointer dereference vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2023-6176)\n",
