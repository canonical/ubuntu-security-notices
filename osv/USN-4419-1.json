  "summary": "linux, linux-lts-xenial, linux-aws, linux-kvm, linux-raspi2, linux-snapdragon vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Precision Time\nProtocol (PTP) implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-\nfree vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2020-10690)\n\nMatthew Sheets discovered that the SELinux network label handling\nimplementation in the Linux kernel could be coerced into de-referencing a\nNULL pointer. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2020-10711)\n\nIt was discovered that the SCSI generic (sg) driver in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle certain error conditions correctly. A local privileged\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2020-12770)\n\nIt was discovered that the USB Gadget device driver in the Linux kernel did\nnot validate arguments passed from configfs in some situations. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-13143)\n\nShijie Luo discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly check for a too-large journal size. An attacker\ncould use this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted,\ncould cause a denial of service (soft lockup). (CVE-2020-8992)\n",
