  "details": "Stefan Eissing discovered that the HTTP/2 implementation in Apache\ndid not properly handle upgrade requests from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 in\nsome situations. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service (daemon crash). This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS\nand Ubuntu 19.04. (CVE-2019-0197)\n\nCraig Young discovered that a memory overwrite error existed in\nApache when performing HTTP/2 very early pushes in some situations. A\nremote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (daemon\ncrash). This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 19.04.\n(CVE-2019-10081)\n\nCraig Young discovered that a read-after-free error existed in the\nHTTP/2 implementation in Apache during connection shutdown. A remote\nattacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of service (daemon\ncrash) or possibly expose sensitive information. This issue only\naffected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 19.04. (CVE-2019-10082)\n\nMatei Badanoiu discovered that the mod_proxy component of\nApache did not properly filter URLs when reporting errors in some\nconfigurations. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to\nconduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2019-10092)\n\nDaniel McCarney discovered that mod_remoteip component of Apache\ncontained a stack buffer overflow when parsing headers from a trusted\nintermediary proxy in some situations. A remote attacker controlling a\ntrusted proxy could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 19.04.\n(CVE-2019-10097)\n\nYukitsugu Sasaki discovered that the mod_rewrite component in Apache\nwas vulnerable to open redirects in some situations. A remote attacker\ncould use this to possibly expose sensitive information or bypass\nintended restrictions. (CVE-2019-10098)\n\nJonathan Looney discovered that the HTTP/2 implementation in Apache did\nnot properly limit the amount of buffering for client connections in\nsome situations. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service (unresponsive daemon). This issue only affected Ubuntu\n18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 19.04. (CVE-2019-9517)\n",
