  "details": "USN-4607-1 fixed vulnerabilities and added features in OpenJDK.\nUnfortunately, that update introduced a regression that could cause TLS\nconnections with client certificate authentication to fail in some\nsituations. This update fixes the problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled deserializing Proxy\n class objects with many interfaces. A remote attacker could possibly use\n this issue to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a\n specially crafted input. (CVE-2020-14779)\n \n Sergey Ostanin discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly restricted\n authentication mechanisms. A remote attacker could possibly use this\n issue to obtain sensitive information over an unencrypted connection.\n (CVE-2020-14781)\n \n It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled untrusted certificates.\n An attacker could possibly use this issue to read or write sensitive\n information. (CVE-2020-14782)\n \n Zhiqiang Zang discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly checked for integer\n overflows. An attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass certain\n Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2020-14792)\n \n Markus Loewe discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly checked permissions when\n converting a file system path to an URI. An attacker could possibly use\n this issue to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2020-14796)\n \n Markus Loewe discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly checked for invalid\n characters when converting an URI to a path. An attacker could possibly\n use this issue to read or write sensitive information. (CVE-2020-14797)\n \n Markus Loewe discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly checked the length of\n input strings. An attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass certain\n Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2020-14798)\n \n It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled boundary checks. An\n attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass certain Java sandbox\n restrictions. (CVE-2020-14803)\n",
