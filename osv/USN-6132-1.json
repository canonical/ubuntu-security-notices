  "details": "\nPatryk Sondej and Piotr Krysiuk discovered that a race condition existed in\nthe netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel when processing batch requests,\nleading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2023-32233)\n\nGwangun Jung discovered that the Quick Fair Queueing scheduler\nimplementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-31436)\n\nReima Ishii discovered that the nested KVM implementation for Intel x86\nprocessors in the Linux kernel did not properly validate control registers\nin certain situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (guest crash). (CVE-2023-30456)\n\nIt was discovered that the Broadcom FullMAC USB WiFi driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly perform data buffer size validation in some\nsituations. A physically proximate attacker could use this to craft a\nmalicious USB device that when inserted, could cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-1380)\n\nZheng Wang discovered that the Intel i915 graphics driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a\ndouble-free. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2022-3707)\n\nJordy Zomer and Alexandra Sandulescu discovered that the Linux kernel did\nnot properly implement speculative execution barriers in usercopy functions\nin certain situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-0459)\n\nIt was discovered that the TLS subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a\ntype confusion vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2023-1075)\n\nIt was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol\nimplementation in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability\nin some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2023-1078)\n\nXingyuan Mo discovered that the x86 KVM implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly initialize some data structures. A local attacker could\nuse this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-1513)\n\nIt was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the iSCSI\nTCP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-2162)\n\nJean-Baptiste Cayrou discovered that the shiftfs file system in the Ubuntu\nLinux kernel contained a race condition when handling inode locking in some\nsituations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(kernel deadlock). (CVE-2023-2612)\n\nIt was discovered that the NET/ROM protocol implementation in the Linux\nkernel contained a race condition in some situations, leading to a use-\nafter-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-32269)\n\nDuoming Zhou discovered that a race condition existed in the infrared\nreceiver/transceiver driver in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-\nfree vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-1118)\n\n",
