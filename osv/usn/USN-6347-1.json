  "details": "\nWilliam Zhao discovered that the Traffic Control (TC) subsystem in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle network packet retransmission in\ncertain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (kernel deadlock). (CVE-2022-4269)\n\nIt was discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly check buffer indexes in certain situations, leading\nto an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use\nthis to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-48502)\n\nSeth Jenkins discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly perform\naddress randomization for a per-cpu memory management structure. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory) or\nin conjunction with another kernel vulnerability. (CVE-2023-0597)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the btrfs file system\nimplementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-1611)\n\nIt was discovered that the APM X-Gene SoC hardware monitoring driver in the\nLinux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2023-1855)\n\nIt was discovered that the ST NCI NFC driver did not properly handle device\nremoval events. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-1990)\n\nRuihan Li discovered that the bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly perform permissions checks when handling HCI sockets. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(bluetooth communication). (CVE-2023-2002)\n\nIt was discovered that the XFS file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly perform metadata validation when mounting certain\nimages. An attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image\nthat, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-2124)\n\nJuan Jose Lopez Jaimez, Meador Inge, Simon Scannell, and Nenad Stojanovski\ndiscovered that the BPF verifier in the Linux kernel did not properly mark\nregisters for precision tracking in certain situations, leading to an out-\nof-bounds access vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-2163)\n\nIt was discovered that the SLIMpro I2C device driver in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate user-supplied data in some situations, leading to\nan out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2023-2194)\n\nIt was discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a\nuse-after-free vulnerability. A privileged local attacker could possibly\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2023-2235)\n\nZheng Zhang discovered that the device-mapper implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle locking during table_clear() operations. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel\ndeadlock). (CVE-2023-2269)\n\nIt was discovered that the ARM Mali Display Processor driver implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions. A\nlocal attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2023-23004)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the TLS subsystem in the\nLinux kernel, leading to a use-after-free or a null pointer dereference\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-28466)\n\nIt was discovered that the DA9150 charger driver in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle device removal, leading to a user-after free\nvulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-30772)\n\nIt was discovered that the Ricoh R5C592 MemoryStick card reader driver in\nthe Linux kernel contained a race condition during module unload, leading\nto a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause\na denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-3141)\n\nQuentin Minster discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate pointers in some situations, leading to a\nnull pointer dereference vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-32248)\n\nIt was discovered that the kernel->user space relay implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly perform certain buffer calculations, leading\nto an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information\n(kernel memory). (CVE-2023-3268)\n\nIt was discovered that the Qualcomm EMAC ethernet driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle device removal, leading to a user-after free\nvulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-33203)\n\nIt was discovered that the BQ24190 charger driver in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle device removal, leading to a user-after free\nvulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-33288)\n\nIt was discovered that the video4linux driver for Philips based TV cards in\nthe Linux kernel contained a race condition during device removal, leading\nto a use-after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2023-35823)\n\nIt was discovered that the SDMC DM1105 PCI device driver in the Linux\nkernel contained a race condition during device removal, leading to a use-\nafter-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode.
