  "details": "Tilman Schmidt and Sasha Levin discovered a use-after-free condition in the\nTTY implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\nexpose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2015-8964)\n\nIt was discovered that the Video For Linux Two (v4l2) implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle multiple planes when processing a\nVIDIOC_DQBUF ioctl(). A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-4568)\n\nCAI Qian discovered that shared bind mounts in a mount namespace\nexponentially added entries without restriction to the Linux kernel's mount\ntable. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2016-6213)\n\nOndrej Kozina discovered that the keyring interface in the Linux kernel\ncontained a buffer overflow when displaying timeout events via the\n/proc/keys interface. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2016-7042)\n\nAndreas Gruenbacher and Jan Kara discovered that the filesystem\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not clear the setgid bit during a\nsetxattr call. A local attacker could use this to possibly elevate group\nprivileges. (CVE-2016-7097)\n\nMarco Grassi discovered that the driver for Areca RAID Controllers in the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate control messages. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain\nprivileges. (CVE-2016-7425)\n\nIt was discovered that the KVM implementation for x86/x86_64 in the Linux\nkernel could dereference a null pointer. An attacker in a guest virtual\nmachine could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the\nKVM host. (CVE-2016-8630)\n\nEyal Itkin discovered that the IP over IEEE 1394 (FireWire) implementation\nin the Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow when handling fragmented\npackets. A remote attacker could use this to possibly execute arbitrary\ncode with administrative privileges. (CVE-2016-8633)\n\nMarco Grassi discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel\nmishandles socket buffer (skb) truncation. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-8645)\n\nDaxing Guo discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the Broadcom\nIEEE802.11n FullMAC driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain\nprivileges. (CVE-2016-8658)\n\nIt was discovered that an information leak existed in __get_user_asm_ex()\nin the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2016-9178)\n\nAndrey Konovalov discovered that the SCTP implementation in the Linux\nkernel improperly handled validation of incoming data. A remote attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-9555)\n",
