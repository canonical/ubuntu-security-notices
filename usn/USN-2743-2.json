If a user were tricked in to\n opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\n this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or obtain\n sensitive information. (CVE-2015-4504)\n \n Khalil Zhani discovered a buffer overflow when parsing VP9 content in some\n circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\n website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of\n service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the\n privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-4506)\n \n Spandan Veggalam discovered a crash while using the debugger API in some\n circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\n website whilst using the debugger, an attacker could potentially exploit\n this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking\n Firefox. (CVE-2015-4507)\n \n Juho Nurminen discovered that the URL bar could display the wrong URL in\n reader mode in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a\n specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\n conduct URL spoofing attacks. (CVE-2015-4508)\n \n A use-after-free was discovered when manipulating HTML media content in\n some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially\n crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a\n denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with\n the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-4509)\n \n Looben Yang discovered a use-after-free when using a shared worker with\n IndexedDB in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a\n specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\n cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code\n with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-4510)\n \n Francisco Alonso discovered an out-of-bounds read during 2D canvas\n rendering in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a\n specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\n obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2015-4512)\n \n Jeff Walden discovered that changes could be made to immutable properties\n in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially\n crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute\n arbitrary script in a privileged scope. (CVE-2015-4516)\n \n Ronald Crane reported multiple vulnerabilities. If a user were tricked in\n to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\n exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or\n execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.\n (CVE-2015-4517, CVE-2015-4521, CVE-2015-4522, CVE-2015-7174,\n CVE-2015-7175, CVE-2015-7176, CVE-2015-7177, CVE-2015-7180)\n \n Mario Gomes discovered that dragging and dropping an image after a\n redirect exposes the redirected URL to scripts. An attacker could\n potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2015-4519)\n \n Ehsan Akhgari discovered 2 issues with CORS preflight requests.
