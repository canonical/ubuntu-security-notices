  "summary": "linux vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the nested KVM implementation in the Linux kernel in\nsome situations did not properly prevent second level guests from reading\nand writing the hardware CR8 register. A local attacker in a guest could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-12154)\n\nFan Wu, Haoran Qiu, and Shixiong Zhao discovered that the associative array\nimplementation in the Linux kernel sometimes did not properly handle adding\na new entry. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2017-12193)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the ALSA subsystem of\nthe Linux kernel when creating and deleting a port via ioctl(). A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-15265)\n\nIt was discovered that a null pointer dereference vulnerability existed in\nthe DCCP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-1130)\n\nJulian Stecklina and Thomas Prescher discovered that FPU register states\n(such as MMX, SSE, and AVX registers) which are lazily restored are\npotentially vulnerable to a side channel attack. A local attacker could use\nthis to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-3665)\n\nWang Qize discovered that an information disclosure vulnerability existed\nin the SMBus driver for ACPI Embedded Controllers in the Linux kernel. A\nlocal attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel\npointer addresses). (CVE-2018-5750)\n\nIt was discovered that the SCTP Protocol implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate userspace provided payload lengths in some\nsituations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2018-5803)\n\nIt was discovered that an integer overflow error existed in the futex\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-6927)\n\nIt was discovered that an information leak vulnerability existed in the\nfloppy driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\nexpose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2018-7755)\n\nIt was discovered that a memory leak existed in the SAS driver subsystem of\nthe Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2018-7757)\n",
