  "description": "Imran Ghory found a race condition in the handling of output files.\nWhile a file was unpacked with cpio, a local attacker with write\npermissions to the target directory could exploit this to change the\npermissions of arbitrary files of the cpio user. (CAN-2005-1111)\n\nImran Ghory discovered a path traversal vulnerability. Even when the\n--no-absolute-filenames option was specified, cpio did not filter out\n\"..\" path components. By tricking an user into unpacking a malicious\ncpio archive, this could be exploited to install files in arbitrary\npaths with the privileges of the user calling cpio. (CAN-2005-1229)",
