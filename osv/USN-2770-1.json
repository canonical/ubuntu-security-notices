  "details": "It was discovered that ContainerNode::parserInsertBefore in Blink would\nincorrectly proceed with a DOM tree insertion in some circumstances. If a\nuser were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker\ncould potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions.\n(CVE-2015-6755)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in the service worker implementation in\nChromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\nwebsite, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of\nservice via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-6757)\n\nIt was discovered that Blink did not ensure that the origin of\nLocalStorage resources are considered unique. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2015-6759)\n\nA race condition and memory corruption was discovered in FFmpeg. If a user\nwere tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash,\nor execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render\nprocess. (CVE-2015-6761)\n\nIt was discovered that CSSFontFaceSrcValue::fetch in Blink did not use\nCORS in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a\nspecially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\nbypass same origin restrictions. (CVE-2015-6762)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial\nof service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-6763)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked\nin to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\nexploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via\nrenderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nsandboxed render process.
