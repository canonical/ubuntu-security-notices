  "details": "Justin Yackoski discovered that the Atheros L2 Ethernet Driver in the Linux\nkernel incorrectly enables scatter/gather I/O. A remote attacker could use\nthis to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.\n(CVE-2016-2117)\n\nJann Horn discovered that eCryptfs improperly attempted to use the mmap()\nhandler of a lower filesystem that did not implement one, causing a\nrecursive page fault to occur. A local unprivileged attacker could use to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code\nwith administrative privileges. (CVE-2016-1583)\n\nJason A. Donenfeld discovered multiple out-of-bounds reads in the OZMO USB\nover wifi device drivers in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or obtain potentially\nsensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2015-4004)\n\nRalf Spenneberg discovered that the Linux kernel's GTCO digitizer USB\ndevice driver did not properly validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker\nwith physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2016-2187)\n\nSergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the\nMCT USB RS232 Converter device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly\nvalidate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-3136)\n\nSergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the\nCypress M8 USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate\nUSB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-3137)\n\nSergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the\nLinux kernel's USB driver for Digi AccelePort serial converters did not\nproperly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-3140)\n\nHector Marco and Ismael Ripoll discovered that the Linux kernel would\nimproperly disable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) for x86\nprocesses running in 32 bit mode if stack-consumption resource limits were\ndisabled. A local attacker could use this to make it easier to exploit an\nexisting vulnerability in a setuid/setgid program. (CVE-2016-3672)\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel's USB driver for IMS Passenger\nControl Unit devices did not properly validate the device's interfaces. An\nattacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2016-3689)\n\nAndrey Konovalov discovered that the CDC Network Control Model USB driver\nin the Linux kernel did not cancel work events queued if a later error\noccurred, resulting in a use-after-free. An attacker with physical access\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-3951)\n\nIt was discovered that an out-of-bounds write could occur when handling\nincoming packets in the USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-3955)\n\nKangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2\nSupport implementations in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use\nthis to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.\n(CVE-2016-4485)\n\nKangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the routing netlink socket\ninterface (rtnetlink) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker\ncould use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel\nmemory. (CVE-2016-4486)\n\nIt was discovered that in some situations the Linux kernel did not handle\npropagated mounts correctly. A local unprivileged attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-4581)\n",
