  "details": "USN-6038-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in Go 1.18. This update provides\nthe corresponding updates for Go 1.13 and Go 1.16.\n\nCVE-2022-29526 and CVE-2022-30630 only affected Go 1.16.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that the Go net/http module incorrectly handled\n Transfer-Encoding headers in the HTTP/1 client. A remote attacker could\n possibly use this issue to perform an HTTP Request Smuggling attack.\n (CVE-2022-1705)\n \n It was discovered that Go did not properly manage memory under certain\n circumstances. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a panic\n resulting into a denial of service. (CVE-2022-1962, CVE-2022-27664,\n CVE-2022-28131, CVE-2022-30630, CVE-2022-30631, CVE-2022-30632,\n CVE-2022-30633, CVE-2022-30635, CVE-2022-32189, CVE-2022-41715,\n CVE-2022-41717, CVE-2023-24534, CVE-2023-24537)\n \n It was discovered that Go did not properly implemented the maximum size of\n file headers in Reader.Read. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\n cause a panic resulting into a denial of service. (CVE-2022-2879)\n \n It was discovered that the Go net/http module incorrectly handled query\n parameters in requests forwarded by ReverseProxy. A remote attacker could\n possibly use this issue to perform an HTTP Query Parameter Smuggling attack.\n (CVE-2022-2880)\n \n It was discovered that Go did not properly manage the permissions for\n Faccessat function. A attacker could possibly use this issue to expose\n sensitive information. (CVE-2022-29526)\n \n It was discovered that Go did not properly generate the values for\n ticket_age_add in session tickets. An attacker could possibly use this\n issue to observe TLS handshakes to correlate successive connections by\n comparing ticket ages during session resumption. (CVE-2022-30629)\n \n It was discovered that Go did not properly manage client IP addresses in\n net/http. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause ReverseProxy\n to set the client IP as the value of the X-Forwarded-For header.\n (CVE-2022-32148)\n \n It was discovered that Go did not properly validate backticks (`) as\n Javascript string delimiters, and do not escape them as expected. An\n attacker could possibly use this issue to inject arbitrary Javascript code\n into the Go template. (CVE-2023-24538)\n",
