  "details": "Jesse Hertz and Tim Newsham discovered that the Linux netfilter\nimplementation did not correctly perform validation when handling 32 bit\ncompatibility IPT_SO_SET_REPLACE events on 64 bit platforms. A local\nunprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.\n(CVE-2016-4997)\n\nKangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the core USB implementation in\nthe Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially\nsensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2016-4482)\n\nJann Horn discovered that the InfiniBand interfaces within the Linux kernel\ncould be coerced into overwriting kernel memory. A local unprivileged\nattacker could use this to possibly gain administrative privileges on\nsystems where InifiniBand related kernel modules are loaded.\n(CVE-2016-4565)\n\nKangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the timer handling\nimplementation in the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem of\nthe Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially\nsensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2016-4569, CVE-2016-4578)\n\nKangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the X.25 Call Request handling\nin the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially\nsensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2016-4580)\n\nIt was discovered that an information leak exists in the Rock Ridge\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker who is able to mount a\nmalicious iso9660 file system image could exploit this flaw to obtain\npotentially sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2016-4913)\n\nJesse Hertz and Tim Newsham discovered that the Linux netfilter\nimplementation did not correctly perform validation when handling\nIPT_SO_SET_REPLACE events. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or obtain potentially sensitive\ninformation from kernel memory. (CVE-2016-4998)\n",
