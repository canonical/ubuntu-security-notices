  "summary": "linux-raspi2 vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations,\nleading to a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker who could start and\ncontrol a VM could possibly use this to expose sensitive information or\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-22543)\n\nIt was discovered that the tracing subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly keep track of per-cpu ring buffer state. A privileged attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2021-3679)\n\nAlois Wohlschlager discovered that the overlay file system in the Linux\nkernel did not restrict private clones in some situations. An attacker\ncould use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-3732)\n\nIt was discovered that the MAX-3421 host USB device driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle device removal events. A physically\nproximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2021-38204)\n\nIt was discovered that the Xilinx 10/100 Ethernet Lite device driver in the\nLinux kernel could report pointer addresses in some situations. An attacker\ncould use this information to ease the exploitation of another\nvulnerability. (CVE-2021-38205)\n",
