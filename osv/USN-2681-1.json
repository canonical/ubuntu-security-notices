  "details": "\nA flaw was discovered in the user space memory copying for the pipe iovecs\nin the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially escalate their\nprivileges. (CVE-2015-1805)\n\nA flaw was discovered in the kvm (kernel virtual machine) subsystem's\nkvm_apic_has_events function. A unprivileged local user could exploit this\nflaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-4692)\n\nDaniel Borkmann reported a kernel crash in the Linux kernel's BPF filter\nJIT optimization. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-4700)\n\nA flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles invalid UDP\nchecksums. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of\nservice using a flood of UDP packets with invalid checksums.\n(CVE-2015-5364)\n\nA flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles invalid UDP\nchecksums. A remote attacker can cause a denial of service against\napplications that use epoll by injecting a single packet with an invalid\nchecksum. (CVE-2015-5366)\n\nA double free flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's path lookup. A\nlocal user could cause a denial of service (Oops). (CVE-2015-5706)\n",
