                "description": "Jesse Hertz and Tim Newsham discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not correctly perform validation when handling 32 bit compatibility IPT_SO_SET_REPLACE events on 64 bit platforms. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges. (CVE-2016-4997)  Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the core USB implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2016-4482)  Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the timer handling implementation in the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2016-4569, CVE-2016-4578)  Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the X.25 Call Request handling in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2016-4580)  It was discovered that an information leak exists in the Rock Ridge implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker who is able to mount a malicious iso9660 file system image could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2016-4913)  Baozeng Ding discovered that the Transparent Inter-process Communication (TIPC) implementation in the Linux kernel did not verify socket existence before use in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-4951)  Jesse Hertz and Tim Newsham discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not correctly perform validation when handling IPT_SO_SET_REPLACE events. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2016-4998)",
