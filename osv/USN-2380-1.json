  "details": "Michal Zalewski discovered that Bash incorrectly handled parsing certain\nfunction definitions. If an attacker were able to create an environment\nvariable containing a function definition with a very specific name, these\nissues could possibly be used to bypass certain environment restrictions\nand execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-6277, CVE-2014-6278)\n\nPlease note that the previous Bash security update, USN-2364-1, includes\na hardening measure that prevents these issues from being used in a\nShellshock attack.\n",
