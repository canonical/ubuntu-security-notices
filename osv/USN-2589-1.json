  "details": "Jan Beulich discovered the Xen virtual machine subsystem of the Linux\nkernel did not properly restrict access to PCI command registers. A local\nguest user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (host\ncrash). (CVE-2015-2150)\n\nA stack overflow was discovered in the the microcode loader for the intel\nx86 platform. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of\nservice (kernel crash) or to potentially execute code with kernel\nprivileges. (CVE-2015-2666)\n\nA privilege escalation was discovered in the fork syscall via the int80\nentry on 64 bit kernels with 32 bit emulation support. An unprivileged\nlocal attacker could exploit this flaw to increase their privileges on the\nsystem. (CVE-2015-2830)\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel's IPv6 networking stack has a flaw\nthat allows using route advertisement (RA) messages to set the 'hop_limit'\nto values that are too low. An unprivileged attacker on a local network\ncould exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (IPv6 messages\ndropped). (CVE-2015-2922)\n",
