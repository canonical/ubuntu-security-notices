  "details": "Jann Horn discovered that the OverlayFS and ShiftFS Drivers in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle reference counting during memory mapping\noperations when used in conjunction with AUFS. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2019-15794)\n\nIt was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the 802.11 Wi-Fi\nconfiguration interface for the Linux kernel when handling beacon settings.\nA local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-16746)\n\nIt was discovered that there was a memory leak in the Advanced Buffer\nManagement functionality of the Netronome NFP4000/NFP6000 NIC Driver in the\nLinux kernel during certain error scenarios. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19076)\n",
