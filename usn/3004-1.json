  "description": "Justin Yackoski discovered that the Atheros L2 Ethernet Driver in the Linux\nkernel incorrectly enables scatter/gather I/O. A remote attacker could use\nthis to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.\n(CVE-2016-2117)\n\nJann Horn discovered that eCryptfs improperly attempted to use the mmap()\nhandler of a lower filesystem that did not implement one, causing a\nrecursive page fault to occur. A local unprivileged attacker could use to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code\nwith administrative privileges. (CVE-2016-1583)\n\nJason A. Donenfeld discovered multiple out-of-bounds reads in the OZMO USB\nover wifi device drivers in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or obtain potentially\nsensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2015-4004)\n\nRalf Spenneberg discovered that the Linux kernel's GTCO digitizer USB\ndevice driver did not properly validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker\nwith physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2016-2187)\n\nHector Marco and Ismael Ripoll discovered that the Linux kernel would\nimproperly disable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) for x86\nprocesses running in 32 bit mode if stack-consumption resource limits were\ndisabled. A local attacker could use this to make it easier to exploit an\nexisting vulnerability in a setuid/setgid program. (CVE-2016-3672)\n\nAndrey Konovalov discovered that the CDC Network Control Model USB driver\nin the Linux kernel did not cancel work events queued if a later error\noccurred, resulting in a use-after-free. An attacker with physical access\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-3951)\n\nIt was discovered that an out-of-bounds write could occur when handling\nincoming packets in the USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-3955)\n\nVitaly Kuznetsov discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly suppress\nhugetlbfs support in X86 paravirtualized guests. An attacker in the guest\nOS could cause a denial of service (guest system crash). (CVE-2016-3961)\n\nKangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2\nSupport implementations in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use\nthis to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.\n(CVE-2016-4485)\n\nKangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the routing netlink socket\ninterface (rtnetlink) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker\ncould use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel\nmemory. (CVE-2016-4486)\n\nJann Horn discovered that the InfiniBand interfaces within the Linux kernel\ncould be coerced into overwriting kernel memory. A local unprivileged\nattacker could use this to possibly gain administrative privileges on\nsystems where InifiniBand related kernel modules are loaded.\n(CVE-2016-4565)\n\nIt was discovered that in some situations the Linux kernel did not handle\npropagated mounts correctly. A local unprivileged attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-4581)\n",
