An attacker\ncould exploit these to cause a denial of service or expose sensitive\ndata over the network. (CVE-2015-0460, CVE-2015-0469)\n\nAlexander Cherepanov discovered that OpenJDK JRE was vulnerable to\ndirectory traversal issues with respect to handling jar files. An\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive data. (CVE-2015-0480)\n\nFlorian Weimer discovered that the RSA implementation in the JCE\ncomponent in OpenJDK JRE did not follow recommended practices for\nimplementing RSA signatures. An attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive data. (CVE-2015-0478)\n\nA vulnerability was discovered in the OpenJDK JRE related to data\nintegrity. An attacker could exploit this expose sensitive data over\nthe network. (CVE-2015-0477)\n\nA vulnerability was discovered in the OpenJDK JRE related to\navailability. An attacker could exploit these to cause a denial\nof service. (CVE-2015-0488)\n",
