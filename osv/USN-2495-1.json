If\na user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker\ncould potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer\ncrash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed\nrender process. (CVE-2015-1209)\n\nIt was discovered that V8 did not properly consider frame access\nrestrictions when throwing exceptions in some circumstances. If a user\nwere tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions.\n(CVE-2015-1210)\n\nIt was discovered that Chromium did not properly restrict the URI scheme\nduring ServiceWorker registration. If a user were tricked in to\ndownloading and opening a specially crafted HTML file, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to bypass security restrictions. (CVE-2015-1211)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial\nof service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user invoking the program.
