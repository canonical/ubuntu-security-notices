  "details": "It was discovered that OpenJDK did not restrict the set of algorithms used\nfor Jar integrity verification. An attacker could use this to modify\nwithout detection the content of a JAR file, affecting system integrity.\n(CVE-2016-5542)\n\nIt was discovered that the JMX component of OpenJDK did not sufficiently\nperform classloader consistency checks. An attacker could use this to\nbypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2016-5554)\n\nIt was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not properly\ncheck received Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) packets. An attacker could\nuse this to send debugging commands to a Java application with debugging\nenabled. (CVE-2016-5573)\n\nIt was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not properly\ncheck arguments of the System.arraycopy() function in certain cases. An\nattacker could use this to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n(CVE-2016-5582)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly handle HTTP proxy\nauthentication. An attacker could use this to expose HTTPS server\nauthentication credentials. (CVE-2016-5597)\n",
