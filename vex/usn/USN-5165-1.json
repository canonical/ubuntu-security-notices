                "description": "It was discovered that the NFC subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability in its NFC Controller Interface (NCI) implementation. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3760)  It was discovered that the SCTP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly verify VTAGs in some situations. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (connection disassociation). (CVE-2021-3772)  It was discovered that the AMD Radeon GPU driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate writes in the debugfs file system. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-42327)  Luo Likang discovered that the FireDTV Firewire driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-42739)  It was discovered that the KVM implementation for POWER8 processors in the Linux kernel did not properly keep track if a wakeup event could be resolved by a guest. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host OS crash). (CVE-2021-43056)  It was discovered that the TIPC Protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate MSG_CRYPTO messages in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-43267)  It was discovered that the ISDN CAPI implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in certain situations that could trigger an array out-of-bounds bug. A privileged local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-43389)",
