This update provides\nthe corresponding update for Ubuntu 12.04 ESM.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Keegan Ryan discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled ECDSA key\n generation. An attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a\n cache-timing attack and recover private ECDSA keys. (CVE-2018-0495)\n\n Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled very large prime\n values during a key agreement. A remote attacker could possibly use this\n issue to consume resources, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2018-0732)\n\n Alejandro Cabrera Aldaya, Billy Brumley, Cesar Pereida Garcia and Luis\n Manuel Alvarez Tapia discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled RSA key\n generation. An attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a\n cache-timing attack and recover private RSA keys. (CVE-2018-0737)\n",
