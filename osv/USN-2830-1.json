  "details": "Guy Leaver discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled a ServerKeyExchange\nfor an anonymous DH ciphersuite with the value of p set to 0. A remote\nattacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting\nin a denial of service. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 15.10.\n(CVE-2015-1794)\n\nHanno B\u00f6ck discovered that the OpenSSL Montgomery squaring procedure\nalgorithm may produce incorrect results when being used on x86_64. A remote\nattacker could possibly use this issue to break encryption. This issue only\napplied to Ubuntu 15.10. (CVE-2015-3193)\n\nLo\u00efc Jonas Etienne discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled ASN.1\nsignatures with a missing PSS parameter. A remote attacker could possibly\nuse this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n(CVE-2015-3194)\n\nAdam Langley discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled malformed\nX509_ATTRIBUTE structures. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue\nto cause OpenSSL to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service.\n(CVE-2015-3195)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled PSK identity hints. A\nremote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash,\nresulting in a denial of service. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04\nLTS, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 15.04.
