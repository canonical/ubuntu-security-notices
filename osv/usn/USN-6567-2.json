  "details": "USN-6567-1 fixed vulnerabilities QEMU. The fix for CVE-2023-2861 was too\nrestrictive and introduced a behaviour change leading to a regression in\ncertain environments. This update fixes the problem.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Gaoning Pan and Xingwei Li discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the\n USB xHCI controller device. A privileged guest attacker could possibly use\n this issue to cause QEMU to crash, leading to a denial of service. This\n issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2020-14394)\n \n It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the TCG Accelerator. A\n local attacker could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, leading to a\n denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code and esclate\n privileges. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2020-24165)\n \n It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the Intel HD audio device.\n A malicious guest attacker could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash,\n leading to a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.\n (CVE-2021-3611)\n \n It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the ATI VGA device. A\n malicious guest attacker could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash,\n leading to a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.\n (CVE-2021-3638)\n \n It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the VMWare paravirtual RDMA\n device. A malicious guest attacker could use this issue to cause QEMU to\n crash, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2023-1544)\n \n It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the 9p passthrough\n filesystem. A malicious guest attacker could possibly use this issue to\n open special files and escape the exported 9p tree. This issue only\n affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 23.04.\n (CVE-2023-2861)\n \n It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the virtual crypto device.\n A malicious guest attacker could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash,\n leading to a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This\n issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 23.04.\n (CVE-2023-3180)\n \n It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the built-in VNC server.\n A remote authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU\n to stop responding, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only\n affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and Ubuntu 23.04. (CVE-2023-3255)\n \n It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled net device hot-unplugging.\n A malicious guest attacker could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash,\n leading to a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS\n and Ubuntu 23.04. (CVE-2023-3301)\n \n It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the built-in VNC server.\n A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to crash,\n resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04\n LTS, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 23.04. (CVE-2023-3354)\n \n It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled NVME devices. A malicious\n guest attacker could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, leading to a\n denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 23.10. (CVE-2023-40360)\n \n It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled NVME devices. A malicious\n guest attacker could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, leading to a\n denial of service, or possibly obtain sensitive information. This issue\n only affected Ubuntu 23.10. (CVE-2023-4135)\n \n It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled SCSI devices. A malicious\n guest attacker could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, leading to a\n denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 23.04 and Ubuntu 23.10.\n (CVE-2023-42467)\n \n It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled certain disk offsets. A\n malicious guest attacker could possibly use this issue to gain control of\n the host in certain nested virtualization scenarios. (CVE-2023-5088)\n",
