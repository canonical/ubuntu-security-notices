  "description": "USN-3338-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel. However, the fix\nfor CVE-2017-1000364 introduced regressions for some Java applications.\nThis update addresses the issue. We apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that the stack guard page for processes in the Linux\n kernel was not sufficiently large enough to prevent overlapping with the\n heap. An attacker could leverage this with another vulnerability to execute\n arbitrary code and gain administrative privileges (CVE-2017-1000364)\n\n Jesse Hertz and Tim Newsham discovered that the Linux netfilter\n implementation did not correctly perform validation when handling 32 bit\n compatibility IPT_SO_SET_REPLACE events on 64 bit platforms. A local\n unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\n crash) or execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.\n (CVE-2016-4997)\n",
