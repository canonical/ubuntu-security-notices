This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local\nattacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation (memory from other guests or the host OS). (CVE-2018-3646)\n\nIt was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU\ncore may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU\ncore. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information (memory from the\nkernel or other processes). (CVE-2018-3620)\n\nAndrey Konovalov discovered an out-of-bounds read in the POSIX\ntimers subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2017-18344)\n\nJuha-Matti Tilli discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel\nperformed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when\nhandling incoming packets. A remote attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2018-5390)\n\nJuha-Matti Tilli discovered that the IP implementation in the Linux kernel\nperformed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when\nhandling incoming packet fragments. A remote attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-5391)\n",
