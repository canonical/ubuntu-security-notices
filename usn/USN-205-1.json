By tricking an user or automatic system\nthat uses the Curl library, the curl application, or wget into\nvisiting a specially-crafted web site, a remote attacker could exploit\nthis to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the calling\nuser.\n\nThe Ubuntu 4.10 and 5.04 versions of wget are not affected by this.",
