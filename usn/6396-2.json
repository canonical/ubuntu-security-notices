  "description": "It was discovered that some AMD x86-64 processors with SMT enabled could\nspeculatively execute instructions using a return address from a sibling\nthread. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2022-27672)\n\nDaniel Moghimi discovered that some Intel(R) Processors did not properly\nclear microarchitectural state after speculative execution of various\ninstructions. A local unprivileged user could use this to obtain to\nsensitive information. (CVE-2022-40982)\n\nYang Lan discovered that the GFS2 file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel could attempt to dereference a null pointer in some situations. An\nattacker could use this to construct a malicious GFS2 image that, when\nmounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-3212)\n\nIt was discovered that the NFC implementation in the Linux kernel contained\na use-after-free vulnerability when performing peer-to-peer communication\nin certain conditions. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information\n(kernel memory). (CVE-2023-3863)\n\nIt was discovered that the bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle L2CAP socket release, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-40283)\n\nIt was discovered that some network classifier implementations in the Linux\nkernel contained use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2023-4128)\n",
