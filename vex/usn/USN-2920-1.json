If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions. (CVE-2016-1630)  It was discovered that the PPB_Flash_MessageLoop_Impl::InternalRun  function in Chromium mishandled nested message loops. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions. (CVE-2016-1631)  Multiple use-after-frees were discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2016-1633, CVE-2016-1634, CVE-2016-1644)  It was discovered that the PendingScript::notifyFinished function in Blink relied on memory-cache information about integrity-check occurrences instead of integrity-check successes. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass Subresource Integrity (SRI) protections. (CVE-2016-1636)  It was discovered that the SkATan2_255 function in Skia mishandled arctangent calculations. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2016-1637)  A use-after-free was discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2016-1641)  Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2016-1642)  A type-confusion bug was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2016-1643)  Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2016-2843)  An invalid cast was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2016-2844)  It was discovered that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in Blink did not ignore a URL's path component in the case of a ServiceWorker fetch. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2016-2845)",
