  "summary": "linux, linux-aws, linux-gke, linux-raspi2, linux-snapdragon vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that a use-after-free flaw existed in the filesystem\nencryption subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-7374)\n\nAndrey Konovalov discovered an out-of-bounds access in the IPv6 Generic\nRouting Encapsulation (GRE) tunneling implementation in the Linux kernel.\nAn attacker could use this to possibly expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2017-5897)\n\nAndrey Konovalov discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle invalid IP options in some situations. An\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2017-5970)\n\nGareth Evans discovered that the shm IPC subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly restrict mapping page zero. A local privileged attacker could\nuse this to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-5669)\n\nAlexander Popov discovered that a race condition existed in the Stream\nControl Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation in the Linux kernel. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2017-5986)\n\nDmitry Vyukov discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly handle TCP\npackets with the URG flag. A remote attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2017-6214)\n\nAndrey Konovalov discovered that the LLC subsytem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly set up a destructor in certain situations. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-6345)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the AF_PACKET handling\ncode in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2017-6346)\n\nAndrey Konovalov discovered that the IP layer in the Linux kernel made\nimproper assumptions about internal data layout when performing checksums.\nA local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-6347)\n\nDmitry Vyukov discovered race conditions in the Infrared (IrDA) subsystem\nin the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (deadlock).
