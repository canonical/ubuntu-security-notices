(CVE-2021-4193)\n\nIt was discovered that Vim was not properly performing bounds checks\nwhen updating windows present on a screen, which could result in a\nheap buffer overflow. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\ncause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-0213)\n\nIt was discovered that Vim was incorrectly handling window\nexchanging operations when in Visual mode, which could result in an\nout-of-bounds read. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\nexpose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-0319)\n\nIt was discovered that Vim was incorrectly handling recursion when\nparsing conditional expressions.
