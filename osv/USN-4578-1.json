  "details": "Hadar Manor discovered that the DCCP protocol implementation in the Linux\nkernel improperly handled socket reuse, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-16119)\n\nWen Xu discovered that the XFS file system in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly validate inode metadata in some situations. An attacker could use\nthis to construct a malicious XFS image that, when mounted, could cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-10322)\n\nIt was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel contained\na use-after-free vulnerability when merging free space. An attacker could\nuse this to construct a malicious btrfs image that, when mounted and\noperated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2019-19448)\n\nJay Shin discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle directory access with broken indexing,\nleading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-14314)\n\nGiuseppe Scrivano discovered that the overlay file system in the Linux\nkernel did not properly perform permission checks in some situations. A\nlocal attacker could possibly use this to bypass intended restrictions and\ngain read access to restricted files. (CVE-2020-16120)\n\nIt was discovered that the NFS client implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly perform bounds checking before copying security labels in\nsome situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-25212)\n\nIt was discovered that the NFC implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly perform permissions checks when opening raw sockets. A local\nattacker could use this to create or listen to NFC traffic.\n(CVE-2020-26088)\n",
