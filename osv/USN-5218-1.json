  "details": "Nadav Amit discovered that the hugetlb implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not perform TLB flushes under certain conditions. A local attacker\ncould use this to leak or alter data from other processes that use huge\npages. (CVE-2021-4002)\n\nIt was discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly validate the memory size of certain ring buffer operation\narguments. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-4204)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the overlay file system\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-20321)\n\nIt was discovered that the NFC subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a\nuse-after-free vulnerability in its NFC Controller Interface (NCI)\nimplementation. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3760)\n\nIt was discovered that an integer overflow could be triggered in the eBPF\nimplementation in the Linux kernel when preallocating objects for stack\nmaps. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-41864)\n\nIt was discovered that the KVM implementation for POWER8 processors in the\nLinux kernel did not properly keep track if a wakeup event could be\nresolved by a guest. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to\ncause a denial of service (host OS crash). (CVE-2021-43056)\n\nIt was discovered that the TIPC Protocol implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate MSG_CRYPTO messages in some situations. An\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-43267)\n\nIt was discovered that the ISDN CAPI implementation in the Linux kernel\ncontained a race condition in certain situations that could trigger an\narray out-of-bounds bug. A privileged local attacker could possibly use\nthis to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2021-43389)\n\n",
