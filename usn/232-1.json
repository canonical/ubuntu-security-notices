  "description": "Eric Romang discovered a local Denial of Service vulnerability in the\nhandling of the 'session.save_path' parameter in PHP's Apache 2.0\nmodule. By setting this parameter to an invalid value in an .htaccess\nfile, a local user could crash the Apache server. (CVE-2005-3319)\n\nA Denial of Service flaw was found in the EXIF module. By sending an\nimage with specially crafted EXIF data to a PHP program that\nautomatically evaluates them (e. g. a web gallery), a remote attacker\ncould cause an infinite recursion in the PHP interpreter, which caused\nthe web server to crash. (CVE-2005-3353)\n\nStefan Esser reported a Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in the\nphpinfo() function. By tricking a user into retrieving a specially\ncrafted URL to a PHP page that exposes phpinfo(), a remote attacker\ncould inject arbitrary HTML or web script into the output page and\npossibly steal private data like cookies or session identifiers.\n(CVE-2005-3388)\n\nStefan Esser discovered a vulnerability of the parse_str() function\nwhen it is called with just one argument. By calling such programs\nwith specially crafted parameters, a remote attacker could enable the\n'register_globals' option which is normally turned off for security\nreasons. Once this option is enabled, the remote attacker could\nexploit other security flaws of PHP programs which are normally\nprotected by 'register_globals' being deactivated. (CVE-2005-3389)\n\nStefan Esser discovered that a remote attacker could overwrite the\n$GLOBALS array in PHP programs that allow file uploads and run with\n'register_globals' enabled. Depending on the particular application,\nthis can lead to unexpected vulnerabilities. (CVE-2005-3390)\n\nThe 'gd' image processing and cURL modules did not properly check\nprocessed file names against the 'open_basedir' and 'safe_mode'\nrestrictions, which could be exploited to circumvent these\nlimitations. (CVE-2005-3391)\n\nAnother bypass of the 'open_basedir' and 'safe_mode' restrictions was\nfound in virtual() function. A local attacker could exploit this to\ncircumvent these restrictions with specially crafted PHP INI files\nwhen virtual Apache 2.0 hosts are used. (CVE-2005-3392)\n\nThe mb_send_mail() function did not properly check its arguments for\ninvalid embedded line breaks. By setting the 'To:' field of an email\nto a specially crafted value in a PHP web mail application, a remote\nattacker could inject arbitrary headers into the sent email.\n(CVE-2005-3883)",
