A remote attacker could use this to spoof the output of\nGnuPG and cause unsigned e-mail to appear signed.\n(CVE-2018-12020)\n\nIt was discovered that python-gnupg incorrectly handled the GPG passphrase. A\nremote attacker could send a specially crafted passphrase that would allow them\nto control the output of encryption and decryption operations.\n(CVE-2019-6690)\n\n",
