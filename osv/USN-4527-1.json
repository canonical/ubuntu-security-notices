  "summary": "linux, linux-aws, linux-kvm, linux-lts-xenial, linux-raspi2, linux-snapdragon vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the Conexant 23885 TV card device driver for the\nLinux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some error conditions. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory\nexhaustion). (CVE-2019-19054)\n\nIt was discovered that the Atheros HTC based wireless driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly deallocate in certain error conditions. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2019-19073, CVE-2019-19074)\n\nYue Haibing discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly handle\nreference counting in sysfs for network devices in some situations. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2019-20811)\n\nIt was discovered that the F2FS file system in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly perform bounds checking in some situations, leading to an out-of-\nbounds read. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive\ninformation (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-9445)\n\nIt was discovered that the F2FS file system in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly validate xattr meta data in some situations, leading to an out-of-\nbounds read. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious F2FS image\nthat, when mounted, could expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2019-9453)\n\nIt was discovered that the F2FS file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly perform bounds checking on xattrs in some\nsituations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive\ninformation (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-0067)\n\nIt was discovered that the NFS client implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly perform bounds checking before copying security labels in\nsome situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-25212)\n",
