  "details": "Kiyin (\u5c39\u4eae) discovered that the x25 implementation in the Linux kernel\ncontained overflows when handling addresses from user space. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-35519)\n\nIt was discovered that the fastrpc driver in the Linux kernel did not\nprevent user space applications from sending kernel RPC messages. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges.\n(CVE-2021-28375)\n\nIt was discovered that the TIPC protocol implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate passed encryption key sizes. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2021-29646)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the netfilter subsystem\nof the Linux kernel when replacing tables. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-29650)\n\nArnd Bergmann discovered that the video4linux subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2021-30002)\n",
