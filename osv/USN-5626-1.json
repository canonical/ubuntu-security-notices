A remote attacker could possibly use\nthis issue to reduce performance, leading to a denial of service.\n(CVE-2022-2795)\n\nIt was discovered that Bind incorrectly handled statistics requests. A\nremote attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive memory\ncontents, or cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu\n22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-2881)\n\nIt was discovered that Bind incorrectly handled memory when processing\ncertain Diffie-Hellman key exchanges. A remote attacker could use this\nissue to consume resources, leading to a denial of service. This issue only\naffected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-2906)\n\nMaksym Odinintsev discovered that Bind incorrectly handled answers from\ncache when configured with a zero stale-answer-timeout. A remote attacker\ncould possibly use this issue to cause Bind to crash, resulting in a denial\nof service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
