  "details": "Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the\nLinux kernel could improperly let a nested (level 2) guest access the\nresources of a parent (level 1) guest in certain situations. An attacker\ncould use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-2732)\n\nGregory Herrero discovered that the fix for CVE-2019-14615 to address the\nLinux kernel not properly clearing data structures on context switches for\ncertain Intel graphics processors was incomplete. A local attacker could\nuse this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-8832)\n\nIt was discovered that the IPMI message handler implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain situations. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory\nexhaustion). (CVE-2019-19046)\n\nIt was discovered that the Intel WiMAX 2400 driver in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly deallocate memory in certain situations. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2019-19051)\n\nIt was discovered that the Marvell Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local\nattacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of service (kernel\nmemory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19056)\n\nIt was discovered that the Intel(R) Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux kernel\ndevice driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in\ncertain error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause\na denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19058)\n\nIt was discovered that the Brocade BFA Fibre Channel device driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error\nconditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of\nservice (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19066)\n\nIt was discovered that the Realtek RTL8xxx USB Wi-Fi device driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error\nconditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of\nservice (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19068)\n\nIt was discovered that ZR364XX Camera USB device driver for the Linux\nkernel did not properly initialize memory. A physically proximate attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2019-15217)\n",
