Stephan van Schaik, Alyssa Milburn, Sebastian \u00d6sterlund, Pietro Frigo, Kaveh Razavi, Herbert Bos, Cristiano Giuffrida, Giorgi Maisuradze, Moritz Lipp, Michael Schwarz, Daniel Gruss, and Jo Van Bulck discovered that Intel processors using Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX) could expose memory contents previously stored in microarchitectural buffers to a malicious process that is executing on the same CPU core. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-11135)  It was discovered that certain Intel Xeon processors did not properly restrict access to a voltage modulation interface. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-11139)",
