  "details": "It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing checks to\nguarantee that allocated memory space existed, which could lead to a\nNULL pointer dereference via a specially crafted file. An attacker\ncould possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2022-0907, CVE-2022-0908)\n\nIt was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing checks to\navoid division calculations where the denominator value was zero,\nwhich could lead to an undefined behavior situation via a specially\ncrafted file. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2022-0909)\n\nIt was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing bounds\nchecks, which could lead to an out-of-bounds read via a specially\ncrafted file. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a\ndenial of service or to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-0924)\n\nIt was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing the\ncalculation of data that would eventually be used as a reference for\nbounds checking operations, which could lead to an out-of-bounds\nread via a specially crafted file. An attacker could possibly use\nthis issue to cause a denial of service or to expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2020-19131)\n\nIt was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly terminating a\nfunction execution when processing incorrect data, which could lead\nto an out-of-bounds read via a specially crafted file. An attacker\ncould possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or to\nexpose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-19144)\n\nIt was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing checks\nwhen setting the value for data later used as reference during memory\naccess, which could lead to an out-of-bounds read via a specially\ncrafted file. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a\ndenial of service or to expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2022-22844)\n",
