  "description": "A Denial of Service vulnerability was discovered in the GNU TLS\nlibrary, which provides common cryptographic algorithms and is used by\nmany applications in Ubuntu. Due to a missing consistency check of the\npadding length field, specially crafted ciphertext blocks caused an\nout of bounds memory access which could crash the application. It was\nnot possible to exploit this to execute any attacker specified code.",
