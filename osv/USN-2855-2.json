  "details": "USN-2855-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Samba. The upstream fix for\nCVE-2015-5252 introduced a regression in certain specific environments.\nThis update fixes the problem.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Thilo Uttendorfer discovered that the Samba LDAP server incorrectly handled\n certain packets. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the LDAP\n server to stop responding, resulting in a denial of service. This issue\n only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 15.04 and Ubuntu 15.10.\n (CVE-2015-3223)\n \n Jan Kasprzak discovered that Samba incorrectly handled certain symlinks. A\n remote attacker could use this issue to access files outside the exported\n share path. (CVE-2015-5252)\n \n Stefan Metzmacher discovered that Samba did not enforce signing when\n creating encrypted connections. If a remote attacker were able to perform a\n machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive\n information. (CVE-2015-5296)\n \n It was discovered that Samba incorrectly performed access control when\n using the VFS shadow_copy2 module. A remote attacker could use this issue\n to access snapshots, contrary to intended permissions. (CVE-2015-5299)\n \n Douglas Bagnall discovered that Samba incorrectly handled certain string\n lengths. A remote attacker could use this issue to possibly access\n sensitive information. (CVE-2015-5330)\n \n It was discovered that the Samba LDAP server incorrectly handled certain\n packets. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the LDAP server to\n stop responding, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected\n Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 15.04 and Ubuntu 15.10. (CVE-2015-7540)\n \n Andrew Bartlett discovered that Samba incorrectly checked administrative\n privileges during creation of machine accounts. A remote attacker could\n possibly use this issue to bypass intended access restrictions in certain\n environments. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 15.04 and\n Ubuntu 15.10. (CVE-2015-8467)\n",
