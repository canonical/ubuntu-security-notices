  "details": "Several security issues were discovered in the DOM implementation in\nBlink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,\nan attacker could potentially exploit these to bypass Same Origin Policy\nrestrictions. (CVE-2015-1253, CVE-2015-1254)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in the WebAudio implementation in\nChromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\nwebsite, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of\nservice via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges\nof the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1255)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in the SVG implementation in Blink. If a\nuser were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker\ncould potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer\ncrash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed\nrender process. (CVE-2015-1256)\n\nA security issue was discovered in the SVG implementation in Blink. If a\nuser were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker\ncould potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer\ncrash. (CVE-2015-1257)\n\nAn issue was discovered with the build of libvpx. If a user were tricked\nin to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\nexploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process.\n(CVE-2015-1258)\n\nMultiple use-after-free issues were discovered in the WebRTC\nimplementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a\nspecially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to\ncause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code\nwith the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1260)\n\nAn uninitialized value bug was discovered in the font shaping code in\nBlink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,\nan attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service\nvia renderer crash. (CVE-2015-1262)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial\nof service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1265)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked\nin to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\nexploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via\nrenderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nsandboxed render process.
