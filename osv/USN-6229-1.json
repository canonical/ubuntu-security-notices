  "details": "It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly handling variables used to\nperform memory management operations when processing an image through\ntiffcrop, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow. An attacker could\npossibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2023-25433, CVE-2023-26965)\n\nIt was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly processing numerical\nvalues when dealing with little-endian input data, which could lead to the\nexecution of an invalid operation. An attacker could possibly use this\nissue to cause a denial of service (CVE-2023-26966)\n\nIt was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing bounds checks\nwhen closing a previously opened TIFF file, which could lead to a NULL\npointer dereference. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2023-3316)\n",
