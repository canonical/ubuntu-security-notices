  "details": "\nJordy Zomer and Alexandra Sandulescu discovered that syscalls invoking the\ndo_prlimit() function in the Linux kernel did not properly handle\nspeculative execution barriers. A local attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-0458)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the btrfs file system\nimplementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-1611)\n\nIt was discovered that the XFS file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly perform metadata validation when mounting certain\nimages. An attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image\nthat, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-2124)\n\nIt was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the iSCSI\nTCP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-2162)\n\nIt was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle extra inode size for extended attributes,\nleading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A privileged attacker could\npossibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-2513)\n\nIt was discovered that the IP-VLAN network driver for the Linux kernel did\nnot properly initialize memory in some situations, leading to an out-of-\nbounds write vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3090)\n\nIt was discovered that the Ricoh R5C592 MemoryStick card reader driver in\nthe Linux kernel contained a race condition during module unload, leading\nto a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause\na denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-3141)\n\nIt was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the IEEE\n1394 (Firewire) implementation in the Linux kernel. A privileged attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3159)\n\nSanan Hasanov discovered that the framebuffer console driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly perform checks for font dimension limits. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-3161)\n\nIt was discovered that the kernel->user space relay implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly perform certain buffer calculations, leading\nto an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information\n(kernel memory). (CVE-2023-3268)\n\nIt was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle some error conditions, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3390)\n\nTanguy Dubroca discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly handle certain pointer data type, leading to an out-of-\nbounds write vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-35001)\n\n",
