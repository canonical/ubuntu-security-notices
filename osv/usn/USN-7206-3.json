  "details": "USN-7206-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS to Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.\nThis update provides the corresponding updates for Ubuntu 24.10.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Simon Scannell, Pedro Gallegos, and Jasiel Spelman discovered that rsync\n did not properly handle checksum lengths. An attacker could use this\n issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-12084)\n \n Simon Scannell, Pedro Gallegos, and Jasiel Spelman discovered that rsync\n compared checksums with uninitialized memory. An attacker could exploit\n this issue to leak sensitive information. (CVE-2024-12085)\n \n Simon Scannell, Pedro Gallegos, and Jasiel Spelman discovered that rsync\n incorrectly handled file checksums. A malicious server could use this\n to expose arbitrary client files. (CVE-2024-12086)\n \n Simon Scannell, Pedro Gallegos, and Jasiel Spelman discovered that rsync\n mishandled symlinks for some settings. An attacker could exploit this\n to write files outside the intended directory. (CVE-2024-12087)\n \n Simon Scannell, Pedro Gallegos, and Jasiel Spelman discovered that rsync\n failed to verify symbolic link destinations for some settings. An\n attacker could exploit this for path traversal attacks. (CVE-2024-12088)\n \n Aleksei Gorban discovered a race condition in rsync's handling of\n symbolic links. An attacker could use this to access sensitive\n information or escalate privileges. (CVE-2024-12747)\n",
