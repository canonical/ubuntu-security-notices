  "details": "USN-4254-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04\nLTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux\nHardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu\n14.04 ESM.\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly clear data\nstructures on context switches for certain Intel graphics processors. A\nlocal attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2019-14615)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Virtual Video Test\nDriver in the Linux kernel. An attacker with write access to /dev/video0 on\na system with the vivid module loaded could possibly use this to gain\nadministrative privileges. (CVE-2019-18683)\n\nIt was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly validate metadata, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. An\nattacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when\nmounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-18885)\n\nIt was discovered that multiple memory leaks existed in the Marvell WiFi-Ex\nDriver for the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to\ncause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19057)\n\nIt was discovered that the crypto subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2019-19062)\n\nIt was discovered that the Realtek rtlwifi USB device driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A\nlocal attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel\nmemory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19063)\n\nDan Carpenter discovered that the AppleTalk networking subsystem of the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a\nNULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash). (CVE-2019-19227)\n\nIt was discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle ioctl requests to get emulated CPUID\nfeatures. An attacker with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-19332)\n\nIt was discovered that the B2C2 FlexCop USB device driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2019-15291)\n",
