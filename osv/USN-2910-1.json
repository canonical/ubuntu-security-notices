  "details": "halfdog discovered that OverlayFS, when mounting on top of a FUSE mount,\nincorrectly propagated file attributes, including setuid. A local\nunprivileged attacker could use this to gain privileges. (CVE-2016-1576)\n\nhalfdog discovered that OverlayFS in the Linux kernel incorrectly\npropagated security sensitive extended attributes, such as POSIX ACLs. A\nlocal unprivileged attacker could use this to gain privileges.\n(CVE-2016-1575)\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel keyring subsystem contained a race\nbetween read and revoke operations. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-7550)\n\n\u90ed\u6c38\u521a discovered that the Linux kernel networking implementation did\nnot validate protocol identifiers for certain protocol families, A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2015-8543)\n\nDmitry Vyukov discovered that the pptp implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not verify an address length when setting up a socket. A local attacker\ncould use this to craft an application that exposed sensitive information\nfrom kernel memory. (CVE-2015-8569)\n\nDavid Miller discovered that the Bluetooth implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate the socket address length for Synchronous\nConnection-Oriented (SCO) sockets. A local attacker could use this to\nexpose sensitive information. (CVE-2015-8575)\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel's Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE)\nimplementation did not handle initial zero length segments properly. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (unkillable\ntask). (CVE-2015-8785)\n",
