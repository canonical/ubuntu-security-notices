  "description": "Philippe Antoine discovered that Go incorrectly handled crafted HTTP/2\nstreams. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2022-41723)\n\nMarten Seemann discovered that Go did not properly manage memory under\ncertain circumstances. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause\na panic resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2022-41724)\n\nAmeya Darshan and Jakob Ackermann discovered that Go did not properly\nvalidate the amount of memory and disk files ReadForm can consume. An\nattacker could possibly use this issue to cause a panic resulting in a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2022-41725)\n\nJakob Ackermann discovered that Go incorrectly handled multipart\nforms. An attacker could possibly use this issue to consume an excessive\namount of resources, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2023-24536)\n\nIt was discovered that Go did not properly validate the \"//go:cgo_\"\ndirectives during compilation. An attacker could possibly use this issue\nto inject arbitrary code during compile time. (CVE-2023-39323)\n\nBartek Nowotarski was discovered that the Go net/http module did not\nproperly handle the requests when request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes.\nAn attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a panic resulting into\na denial of service. (CVE-2023-45288)\n\nBartek Nowotarski discovered that the Go net/http module did not properly\nvalidate the total size of the parsed form when parsing a multipart form.\nAn attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a panic resulting into a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2023-45290)\n\nJohn Howard discovered that the Go crypto/x509 module did not properly\nhandle a certificate chain which contains a certificate with an unknown\npublic key algorithm. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause\na panic resulting into a denial of service. (CVE-2024-24783)\n\nJuho Nurminen discovered that the Go net/mail module did not properly\nhandle comments within display names in the ParseAddressList function.\nAn attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a panic resulting into\na denial of service. (CVE-2024-24784)\n\nYufan You discovered that the Go archive/zip module did not properly\nhandle certain types of invalid zip files differs from the behavior of\nmost zip implementations. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\ncause a panic resulting into a denial of service. (CVE-2024-24789)\n\nGeoff Franks discovered that the Go net/http module did not properly\nhandle responses to requests with an \"Expect: 100-continue\" header under\ncertain circumstances. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\ncause a denial of service. (CVE-2024-24791)\n\nIt was discovered that the Go parser module did not properly handle deeply\nnested literal values. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause\na panic resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2024-34155)\n\nMd Sakib Anwar discovered that the Go encoding/gob module did not properly\nhandle message decoding under certain circumstances. An attacker could\npossibly use this issue to cause a panic resulting in a denial of service.\n(CVE-2024-34156)\n\nIt was discovered that the Go build module did not properly handle certain\nbuild tag lines with deeply nested expressions.
