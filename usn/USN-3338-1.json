  "description": "It was discovered that the stack guard page for processes in the Linux\nkernel was not sufficiently large enough to prevent overlapping with the\nheap. An attacker could leverage this with another vulnerability to execute\narbitrary code and gain administrative privileges (CVE-2017-1000364)\n\nJesse Hertz and Tim Newsham discovered that the Linux netfilter\nimplementation did not correctly perform validation when handling 32 bit\ncompatibility IPT_SO_SET_REPLACE events on 64 bit platforms. A local\nunprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.\n(CVE-2016-4997)\n",
