  "description": "Tavis Ormandy discovered that zlib did not properly verify data\nstreams.  Decompressing certain invalid compressed files caused\ncorruption of internal data structures, which caused applications\nwhich link to zlib to crash.  Specially crafted input might even have\nallowed arbitrary code execution.\n\nzlib is used by hundreds of server and client applications, so this\nvulnerability could be exploited to cause Denial of Service attacks to\nalmost all services provided by an Ubuntu system.",
