  "details": "It was discovered that the network block device (nbd) implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly check for error conditions in some\nsituations. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2019-16089)\n\nIt was discovered that the kernel->user space relay implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly check return values in some situations. A\nlocal attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2019-19462)\n\nMauricio Faria de Oliveira discovered that the aufs implementation in the\nLinux kernel improperly managed inode reference counts in the\nvfsub_dentry_open() method. A local attacker could use this vulnerability\nto cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-11935)\n\nJason A. Donenfeld discovered that the ACPI implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly restrict loading ACPI tables via configfs. A\nprivileged attacker could use this to bypass Secure Boot lockdown\nrestrictions and execute arbitrary code in the kernel. (CVE-2020-15780)\n",
