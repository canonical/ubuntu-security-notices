  "details": "Neil Madden discovered that OpenJDK did not properly verify ECDSA\nsignatures. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to insert,\nedit or obtain sensitive information. This issue only affected OpenJDK\n17 and OpenJDK 18. (CVE-2022-21449)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly limited memory when compiling a\nspecially crafted XPath expression. An attacker could possibly use this\nissue to cause a denial of service. This issue was fixed in OpenJDK 8 and\nOpenJDK 18. USN-5388-1 and USN-5388-2 addressed this issue in OpenJDK 11\nand OpenJDK 17. (CVE-2022-21426)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled converting certain\nobject arguments into their textual representations. An attacker could\npossibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue was\nfixed in OpenJDK 8 and OpenJDK 18. USN-5388-1 and USN-5388-2 addressed\nthis issue in OpenJDK 11 and OpenJDK 17. (CVE-2022-21434)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly validated the encoded length of\ncertain object identifiers. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\ncause a denial of service. This issue was fixed in OpenJDK 8 and OpenJDK 18.\nUSN-5388-1 and USN-5388-2 addressed this issue in OpenJDK 11 and OpenJDK 17.\n(CVE-2022-21443)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly validated certain paths. An\nattacker could possibly use this issue to bypass the secure validation\nfeature and expose sensitive information in XML files. This issue was\nfixed in OpenJDK 8 and OpenJDK 18. USN-5388-1 and USN-5388-2 addressed this\nissue in OpenJDK 11 and OpenJDK 17. (CVE-2022-21476)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly parsed certain URI strings. An\nattacker could possibly use this issue to make applications accept\ninvalid of malformed URI strings. This issue was fixed in OpenJDK 8 and\nOpenJDK 18. USN-5388-1 and USN-5388-2 addressed this issue in OpenJDK 11\nand OpenJDK 17. (CVE-2022-21496)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly generated class code in the\nHotspot component. An attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain\nsensitive information. (CVE-2022-21540)\n\nIt was dicovered that OpenJDK incorrectly restricted access to the\ninvokeBasic() method in the Hotspot component. An attacker could possibly\nuse this issue to insert, edit or obtain sensitive information.\n(CVE-2022-21541)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly computed exponentials. An\nattacker could possibly use this issue to insert, edit or obtain sensitive\ninformation. This issue only affected OpenJDK 17.\n(CVE-2022-21549)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenJDK includes a copy of Xalan that incorrectly\nhandled integer truncation. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-34169)\n",
