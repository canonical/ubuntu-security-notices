  "details": "USN-5142-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Samba. Some of the upstream changes\nintroduced regressions in name mapping and backups.\n\nPlease see the following upstream bugs for more information:\nhttps://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14901\nhttps://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14918\n\nThis update fixes the problem.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Stefan Metzmacher discovered that Samba incorrectly handled SMB1 client\n connections. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to downgrade\n connections to plaintext authentication. (CVE-2016-2124)\n \n Andrew Bartlett discovered that Samba incorrectly mapping domain users to\n local users. An authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to\n become root on domain members. (CVE-2020-25717)\n \n Andrew Bartlett discovered that Samba did not correctly sandbox Kerberos\n tickets issues by an RODC. An RODC could print administrator tickets,\n contrary to expectations. (CVE-2020-25718)\n \n Andrew Bartlett discovered that Samba incorrectly handled Kerberos tickets.\n Delegated administrators could possibly use this issue to impersonate\n accounts, leading to total domain compromise. (CVE-2020-25719)\n \n Andrew Bartlett discovered that Samba did not provide stable AD\n identifiers to Kerberos acceptors. (CVE-2020-25721)\n \n Andrew Bartlett discovered that Samba did not properly check sensitive\n attributes. An authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to\n escalate privileges. (CVE-2020-25722)\n \n Stefan Metzmacher discovered that Samba incorrectly handled certain large\n DCE/RPC requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to\n bypass signature requirements. (CVE-2021-23192)\n \n William Ross discovered that Samba incorrectly handled memory. A remote\n attacker could use this issue to cause Samba to crash, resulting in a\n denial of service, or possibly escalate privileges. (CVE-2021-3738)\n \n Joseph Sutton discovered that Samba incorrectly handled certain TGS\n requests. An authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to cause\n Samba to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2021-3671)\n \n The fix for CVE-2020-25717 results in possible behaviour changes that could\n affect certain environments.
