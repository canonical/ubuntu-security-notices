  "details": "USN-4191-2 fixed a vulnerability in QEMU. This update provides the\ncorresponding update for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that the LSI SCSI adapter emulator implementation in QEMU\n did not properly validate executed scripts. A local attacker could use this\n to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-12068)\n\n Sergej Schumilo, Cornelius Aschermann and Simon W\u00f6rner discovered that the\n qxl paravirtual graphics driver implementation in QEMU contained a null\n pointer dereference. A local attacker in a guest could use this to cause a\n denial of service. (CVE-2019-12155)\n\n Riccardo Schirone discovered that the QEMU bridge helper did not properly\n validate network interface names. A local attacker could possibly use this\n to bypass ACL restrictions. (CVE-2019-13164)\n\n It was discovered that a heap-based buffer overflow existed in the SLiRP\n networking implementation of QEMU. A local attacker in a guest could use\n this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code in the\n host. (CVE-2019-14378)\n\n It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the SLiRP\n networking implementation of QEMU. A local attacker in a guest could use\n this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-15890)\n",
