  "description": "Andrew Honig reported a flaw in the way KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)\nemulated the IOAPIC. A privileged guest user could exploit this flaw to\nread host memory or cause a denial of service (crash the host).\n(CVE-2013-1798)\n\nAn information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's rcvmsg path for\nATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode). A local user could exploit this flaw to\nexamine potentially sensitive information from the kernel's stack memory.\n(CVE-2013-3222)\n\nAn information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's recvmsg path for\nax25 address family. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine\npotentially sensitive information from the kernel's stack memory.\n(CVE-2013-3223)\n\nAn information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's recvmsg path for\nthe bluetooth address family. A local user could exploit this flaw to\nexamine potentially sensitive information from the kernel's stack memory.\n(CVE-2013-3224)\n\nAn information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's bluetooth rfcomm\nprotocol support. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine\npotentially sensitive information from the kernel's stack memory.\n(CVE-2013-3225)\n\nAn information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's IRDA (infrared)\nsupport subsystem. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine\npotentially sensitive information from the kernel's stack memory.\n(CVE-2013-3228)\n\nAn information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's s390 - z/VM\nsupport. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially\nsensitive information from the kernel's stack memory. (CVE-2013-3229)\n\nAn information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's llc (Logical Link\nLayer 2) support. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine\npotentially sensitive information from the kernel's stack memory.\n(CVE-2013-3231)\n\nAn information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's receive message\nhandling for the netrom address family. A local user could exploit this\nflaw to obtain sensitive information from the kernel's stack memory.\n(CVE-2013-3232)\n\nAn information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's Rose X.25 protocol\nlayer. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially\nsensitive information from the kernel's stack memory. (CVE-2013-3234)\n\nAn information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's TIPC (Transparent\nInter Process Communication) protocol implementation. A local user could\nexploit this flaw to examine potentially sensitive information from the\nkernel's stack memory. (CVE-2013-3235)\n",

If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.\n",
