  "description": "The splash image handler in xpdf did not check the validity of\ncoordinates. By tricking a user into opening a specially crafted PDF\nfile, an attacker could exploit this to trigger a buffer overflow\nwhich could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of\nthe user.\n\nThe poppler library and kpdf also contain xpdf code, and thus are\naffected by the same vulnerability.",
