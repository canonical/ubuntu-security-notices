  "description": "Muqing Liu and neoni discovered that Apport incorrectly handled detecting\nif an executable was replaced after a crash. A local attacker could\npossibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code as the root user.\n(CVE-2021-3899)\n\nGerrit Venema discovered that Apport incorrectly handled connections to\nApport sockets inside containers. A local attacker could possibly use this\nissue to connect to arbitrary sockets as the root user. (CVE-2022-1242)\n\nGerrit Venema discovered that Apport incorrectly handled user settings\nfiles. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Apport to\nconsume resources, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2022-28652)\n\nGerrit Venema discovered that Apport did not limit the amount of logging\nfrom D-Bus connections. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to\nfill up the Apport log file, leading to a denial of service.\n(CVE-2022-28654)\n\nGerrit Venema discovered that Apport did not filter D-Bus connection\nstrings. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Apport to\nmake arbitrary network connections. (CVE-2022-28655)\n\nGerrit Venema discovered that Apport did not limit the amount of memory\nbeing consumed during D-Bus connections. A local attacker could possibly\nuse this issue to cause Apport to consume memory, leading to a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2022-28656)\n\nGerrit Venema discovered that Apport did not disable the python crash\nhandler before chrooting into a container. A local attacker could possibly\nuse this issue to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-28657)\n\nGerrit Venema discovered that Apport incorrectly handled filename argument\nwhitespace.
