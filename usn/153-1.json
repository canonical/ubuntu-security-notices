  "description": "Ross Boylan discovered a remote buffer overflow in fetchmail. By\nsending invalid responses with very long UIDs, a faulty or malicious\nPOP server could crash fetchmail or execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user invoking fetchmail.\n\nfetchmail is commonly run as root to fetch mail for multiple user\naccounts; in this case, this vulnerability could be exploited to\ncompromise the whole system.",
