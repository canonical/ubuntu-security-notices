  "details": "Eli Biham and Lior Neumann discovered that the Bluetooth implementation in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly validate elliptic curve parameters during\nDiffie-Hellman key exchange in some situations. An attacker could use this\nto expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-5383)\n\nIt was discovered that a heap buffer overflow existed in the Marvell\nWireless LAN device driver for the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2019-10126)\n\nAndrei Vlad Lutas and Dan Lutas discovered that some x86 processors\nincorrectly handle SWAPGS instructions during speculative execution. A\nlocal attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel\nmemory). (CVE-2019-1125)\n\nJann Horn discovered that a race condition existed in the Linux kernel when\nperforming core dumps. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-11599)\n\nIt was discovered that the PowerPC dlpar implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly check for allocation errors in some situations. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2019-12614)\n\nJann Horn discovered that the ptrace implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly record credentials in some situations. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain\nadministrative privileges. (CVE-2019-13272)\n\nIt was discovered that the Marvell Wireless LAN device driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate the BSS descriptor. A local attacker could\npossibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-3846)\n",
