  "details": "USN-3980-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.10.\nThis update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux\nHardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 18.10 for Ubuntu\n18.04 LTS.\n\nKe Sun, Henrique Kawakami, Kekai Hu, Rodrigo Branco, Giorgi Maisuradze, Dan\nHorea Lutas, Andrei Lutas, Volodymyr Pikhur, Stephan van Schaik, Alyssa\nMilburn, Sebastian \u00d6sterlund, Pietro Frigo, Kaveh Razavi, Herbert Bos,\nCristiano Giuffrida, Moritz Lipp, Michael Schwarz, and Daniel Gruss\ndiscovered that memory previously stored in microarchitectural fill buffers\nof an Intel CPU core may be exposed to a malicious process that is\nexecuting on the same CPU core. A local attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2018-12130)\n\nBrandon Falk, Ke Sun, Henrique Kawakami, Kekai Hu, Rodrigo Branco, Stephan\nvan Schaik, Alyssa Milburn, Sebastian \u00d6sterlund, Pietro Frigo, Kaveh\nRazavi, Herbert Bos, and Cristiano Giuffrida discovered that memory\npreviously stored in microarchitectural load ports of an Intel CPU core may\nbe exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the same CPU core. A\nlocal attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2018-12127)\n\nKe Sun, Henrique Kawakami, Kekai Hu, Rodrigo Branco, Marina Minkin, Daniel\nMoghimi, Moritz Lipp, Michael Schwarz, Jo Van Bulck, Daniel Genkin, Daniel\nGruss, Berk Sunar, Frank Piessens, and Yuval Yarom discovered that memory\npreviously stored in microarchitectural store buffers of an Intel CPU core\nmay be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the same CPU\ncore. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2018-12126)\n\nVasily Averin and Evgenii Shatokhin discovered that a use-after-free\nvulnerability existed in the NFS41+ subsystem when multiple network\nnamespaces are in use. A local attacker in a container could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2018-16884)\n\nKe Sun, Henrique Kawakami, Kekai Hu, Rodrigo Branco, Volodrmyr Pikhur,\nMoritz Lipp, Michael Schwarz, Daniel Gruss, Stephan van Schaik, Alyssa\nMilburn, Sebastian \u00d6sterlund, Pietro Frigo, Kaveh Razavi, Herbert Bos, and\nCristiano Giuffrida discovered that uncacheable memory previously stored in\nmicroarchitectural buffers of an Intel CPU core may be exposed to a\nmalicious process that is executing on the same CPU core. A local attacker\ncould use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-11091)\n\nMatteo Croce, Natale Vinto, and Andrea Spagnolo discovered that the cgroups\nsubsystem of the Linux kernel did not properly account for SCTP socket\nbuffers. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2019-3874)\n\nAlex Williamson discovered that the vfio subsystem of the Linux kernel did\nnot properly limit DMA mappings. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-3882)\n\nMarc Orr discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly restrict APIC MSR register values when nested\nvirtualization is used. An attacker in a guest vm could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (host OS crash). (CVE-2019-3887)\n\nHugues Anguelkov discovered that the Broadcom Wifi driver in the Linux\nkernel contained a heap buffer overflow. A physically proximate attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-9500)\n\nHugues Anguelkov discovered that the Broadcom Wifi driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly prevent remote firmware events from being processed\nfor USB Wifi devices. A physically proximate attacker could use this to\nsend firmware events to the device. (CVE-2019-9503)\n",
