  "details": "Daniel Moghimi discovered that some Intel(R) Processors did not properly\nclear microarchitectural state after speculative execution of various\ninstructions. A local unprivileged user could use this to obtain to\nsensitive information. (CVE-2022-40982)\n\nTavis Ormandy discovered that some AMD processors did not properly handle\nspeculative execution of certain vector register instructions. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-20593)\n\nIt was discovered that the universal 32bit network packet classifier\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference\ncounting in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3609)\n\nIt was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle certain error conditions, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3610)\n\nIt was discovered that the Quick Fair Queueing network scheduler\nimplementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3611)\n\nIt was discovered that the network packet classifier with\nnetfilter/firewall marks implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle reference counting, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3776)\n\nKevin Rich discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle table rules flush in certain circumstances. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3777)\n\nKevin Rich discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle rule additions to bound chains in certain\ncircumstances. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-3995)\n\nIt was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle PIPAPO element removal, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-4004)\n\nKevin Rich discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle bound chain deactivation in certain circumstances. A\nlocal attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-4015)\n\n",
