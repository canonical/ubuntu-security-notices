Original advisory details:   It was discovered that Bind incorrectly handled GSSAPI security policy  negotiation. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause Bind to crash,  resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. In  the default installation, attackers would be isolated by the Bind AppArmor  profile.",
