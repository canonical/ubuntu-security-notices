  "details": "USN-5313-1 fixed vulnerabilities and added features in OpenJDK.\nUnfortunately, that update introduced a regression in OpenJDK 11 that\ncould impact interoperability with some popular HTTP/2 servers making\nit unable to connect to said servers. This update fixes the problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled deserialization filters.\n An attacker could possibly use this issue to insert, delete or obtain\n sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21248)\n\n It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly read uncompressed TIFF files.\n An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service via\n a specially crafted TIFF file. (CVE-2022-21277)\n\n Jonni Passki discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly verified access\n restrictions when performing URI resolution. An attacker could possibly\n use this issue to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21282)\n\n It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled certain regular\n expressions in the Pattern class implementation. An attacker could\n possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-21283)\n\n It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled specially crafted Java\n class files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial\n of service. (CVE-2022-21291)\n\n Markus Loewe discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly validated attributes\n during object deserialization. An attacker could possibly use this issue\n to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-21293, CVE-2022-21294)\n\n Dan Rabe discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly verified access permissions\n in the JAXP component. An attacker could possibly use this to specially\n craft an XML file to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21296)\n\n It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled XML entities. An\n attacker could use this to specially craft an XML file that, when parsed,\n would possibly cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-21299)\n\n Zhiqiang Zang discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled array indexes.\n An attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information.\n (CVE-2022-21305)\n\n It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly read very long attributes\n values in JAR file manifests. An attacker could possibly use this to\n specially craft JAR file to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-21340)\n\n It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly validated input from serialized\n streams. An attacker cold possibly use this issue to bypass sandbox\n restrictions. (CVE-2022-21341)\n\n Fabian Meumertzheim discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly handled certain\n specially crafted BMP or TIFF files. An attacker could possibly use this\n to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-21360, CVE-2022-21366)\n\n It was discovered that an integer overflow could be triggered in OpenJDK\n BMPImageReader class implementation. An attacker could possibly use this\n to specially craft a BMP file to cause a denial of service.\n (CVE-2022-21365)\n",
