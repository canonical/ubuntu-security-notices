  "details": "\nIt was discovered that the framebuffer driver on the Linux kernel did not\nverify size limits when changing font or screen size, leading to an out-of-\nbounds write. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-33655)\n\nMoshe Kol, Amit Klein and Yossi Gilad discovered that the IP implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not provide sufficient randomization when\ncalculating port offsets. An attacker could possibly use this to expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2022-1012, CVE-2022-32296)\n\nNorbert Slusarek discovered that a race condition existed in the perf\nsubsystem in the Linux kernel, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.\nA privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1729)\n\nIt was discovered that the device-mapper verity (dm-verity) driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly verify targets being loaded into the device-\nmapper table. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2503)\n\nDomingo Dirutigliano and Nicola Guerrera discovered that the netfilter\nsubsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle rules that truncated\npackets below the packet header size. When such rules are in place, a\nremote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2022-36946)\n\n",
