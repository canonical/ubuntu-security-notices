  "details": "Zhenpeng Lin discovered that the network packet scheduler implementation in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly remove all references to a route filter\nbefore freeing it in some situations. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2022-2588)\n\nIt was discovered that the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel did not\nprevent one nft object from referencing an nft set in another nft table,\nleading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2022-2586)\n\nIt was discovered that the block layer subsystem in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly initialize memory in some situations. A privileged local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2022-0494)\n\nHu Jiahui discovered that multiple race conditions existed in the Advanced\nLinux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework, leading to use-after-free\nvulnerabilities. A local attacker could use these to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1048)\n\nMinh Yuan discovered that the floppy disk driver in the Linux kernel\ncontained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nlocal attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1652)\n\nIt was discovered that the Atheros ath9k wireless device driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle some error conditions, leading to a\nuse-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2022-1679)\n\nIt was discovered that the Marvell NFC device driver implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly perform memory cleanup operations in some\nsituations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker\ncould possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1734)\n\nDuoming Zhou discovered a race condition in the NFC subsystem in the Linux\nkernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A privileged local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1974)\n\nDuoming Zhou discovered that the NFC subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly prevent context switches from occurring during certain atomic\ncontext operations. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-1975)\n\nFelix Fu discovered that the Sun RPC implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle socket states, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-28893)\n\nArthur Mongodin discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly perform data validation. A local attacker could use this\nto escalate privileges in certain situations. (CVE-2022-34918)\n\n",
