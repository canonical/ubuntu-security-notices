This update\nfixes the problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that the postinst maintainer script in Cron unsafely\n handled file permissions during package install or update operations.\n An attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a privilege\n escalation attack. (CVE-2017-9525)\n \n Florian Weimer discovered that Cron incorrectly handled certain memory\n operations during crontab file creation. An attacker could possibly use\n this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-9704)\n \n It was discovered that Cron incorrectly handled user input during crontab\n file creation. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial\n of service. (CVE-2019-9705)\n \n It was discovered that Cron contained a use-after-free vulnerability in\n its force_rescan_user function.
