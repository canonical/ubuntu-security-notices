  "details": "It was discovered that the AMD Cryptographic Coprocessor device driver in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory\nexhaustion). (CVE-2019-18808)\n\nIt was discovered that the Conexant 23885 TV card device driver for the\nLinux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some error conditions. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory\nexhaustion). (CVE-2019-19054)\n\nIt was discovered that the ADIS16400 IIO IMU Driver for the Linux kernel\ndid not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2019-19061)\n\nIt was discovered that the AMD Audio Coprocessor driver for the Linux\nkernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A\nlocal attacker with the ability to load modules could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19067)\n\nIt was discovered that the Atheros HTC based wireless driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly deallocate in certain error conditions. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2019-19073, CVE-2019-19074)\n\nIt was discovered that the F2FS file system in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly perform bounds checking in some situations, leading to an out-of-\nbounds read. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive\ninformation (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-9445)\n\nIt was discovered that the VFIO PCI driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle attempts to access disabled memory spaces. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2020-12888)\n\nIt was discovered that the cgroup v2 subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a NULL\npointer dereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice or possibly gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2020-14356)\n\nIt was discovered that the state of network RNG in the Linux kernel was\npotentially observable. A remote attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information.
