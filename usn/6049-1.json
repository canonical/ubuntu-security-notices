  "description": "It was discovered that Netty's Zlib decoders did not limit memory\nallocations. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause\nNetty to exhaust memory via malicious input, leading to a denial of\nservice. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 ESM and Ubuntu 20.04 ESM.\n(CVE-2020-11612)\n\nIt was discovered that Netty created temporary files with excessive\npermissions. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to expose\nsensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 ESM, Ubuntu\n18.04 ESM, and Ubuntu 20.04 ESM. (CVE-2021-21290)\n\nIt was discovered that Netty did not properly validate content-length\nheaders. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to smuggle\nrequests. This issue was only fixed in Ubuntu 20.04 ESM. (CVE-2021-21295,\nCVE-2021-21409)\n\nIt was discovered that Netty's Bzip2 decompression decoder did not limit\nthe decompressed output data size. A remote attacker could possibly use\nthis issue to cause Netty to exhaust memory via malicious input, leading\nto a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 ESM, Ubuntu\n20.04 ESM, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2021-37136)\n\nIt was discovered that Netty's Snappy frame decoder function did not limit\nchunk lengths. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause\nNetty to exhaust memory via malicious input, leading to a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2021-37137)\n\nIt was discovered that Netty did not properly handle control chars at the\nbeginning and end of header names. A remote attacker could possibly use\nthis issue to smuggle requests. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 ESM,\nUbuntu 20.04 ESM, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 22.10. (CVE-2021-43797)\n\nIt was discovered that Netty could be made into an infinite recursion when\nparsing a malformed crafted message. A remote attacker could possibly use\nthis issue to cause Netty to crash, leading to a denial of service. This\nissue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 ESM, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 22.10.\n(CVE-2022-41881)\n\nIt was discovered that Netty did not validate header values under certain\ncircumstances. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform\nHTTP response splitting via malicious header values. This issue only\naffected Ubuntu 18.04 ESM, Ubuntu 20.04 ESM, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and Ubuntu\n22.10. (CVE-2022-41915)\n",
