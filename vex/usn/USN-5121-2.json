(CVE-2020-12108, CVE-2020-15011)  It was discovered that Mailman improperly sanitize the MIME content. An attacker could obtain sensitive information by sending a special type of attachment. (CVE-2020-12137)  Original advisory details:  Andre Protas, Richard Cloke, and Andy Nuttall discovered that Mailman did not properly associate cross-site request forgery (CSRF) tokens to specific accounts. A remote attacker could use this to perform a CSRF attack to gain access to another account. (CVE-2021-42097)  Andre Protas, Richard Cloke, and Andy Nuttall discovered that Mailman\u2019s cross-site request forgery (CSRF) tokens for the options page are derived from the admin password.
