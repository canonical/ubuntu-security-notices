  "details": "It was discovered that Chromium did not properly manage memory in several\ncomponents. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to corrupt\nmemory via a crafted HTML page, resulting in a denial of service, or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-1528, CVE-2023-1530,\nCVE-2023-1531, CVE-2023-1533, CVE-2023-1811, CVE-2023-1815, CVE-2023-1818)\n\nIt was discovered that Chromium could be made to access memory out of\nbounds in WebHID. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to\ncorrupt memory via a malicious HID device, resulting in a denial of\nservice, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-1529)\n\nIt was discovered that Chromium could be made to access memory out of\nbounds in several components. A remote attacker could possibly use this\nissue to corrupt memory via a crafted HTML page, resulting in a denial of\nservice, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-1532,\nCVE-2023-1534, CVE-2023-1810, CVE-2023-1812, CVE-2023-1819, CVE-2023-1820)\n\nIt was discovered that Chromium contained an inappropriate implementation\nin the Extensions component. A remote attacker who convinced a user to\ninstall a malicious extension could possibly use this issue to bypass file\naccess restrictions via a crafted HTML page. (CVE-2023-1813)\n\nIt was discovered that Chromium did not properly validate untrusted input\nin the Safe Browsing component. A remote attacker could possibly use this\nissue to bypass download checking via a crafted HTML page. (CVE-2023-1814)\n\nIt was discovered that Chromium contained an inappropriate implementation\nin the Picture In Picture component. A remote attacker could possibly use\nthis issue to perform navigation spoofing via a crafted HTML page.\n(CVE-2023-1816)\n\nIt was discovered that Chromium contained an inappropriate implementation\nin the WebShare component. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue\nto hide the contents of the Omnibox (URL bar) via a crafted HTML page.\n(CVE-2023-1821)\n\nIt was discovered that Chromium contained an inappropriate implementation\nin the Navigation component. A remote attacker could possibly use this\nissue to perform domain spoofing via a crafted HTML page. (CVE-2023-1822)\n\nIt was discovered that Chromium contained an inappropriate implementation\nin the FedCM component. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to\nbypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page. (CVE-2023-1823)\n",
