  "details": "Multiple use-after-free bugs were discovered in the application cache\nimplementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a\nspecially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to\ncause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code\nwith the privileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-6765,\nCVE-2015-6766, CVE-2015-6767)\n\nSeveral security issues were discovered in the DOM implementation in\nChromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\nwebsite, an attacker could potentially exploit these to bypass same\norigin restrictions. (CVE-2015-6768, CVE-2015-6770)\n\nA security issue was discovered in the provisional-load commit\nimplementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a\nspecially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\nbypass same origin restrictions. (CVE-2015-6769)\n\nAn out-of-bounds read was discovered in the array map and filter\noperations in V8 in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\nexploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash.\n(CVE-2015-6771)\n\nIt was discovered that the DOM implementation in Chromium does not prevent\njavascript: URL navigation while a document is being detached. If a user\nwere tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions.\n(CVE-2015-6772)\n\nAn out-of bounds read was discovered in Skia in some cirumstances. If a\nuser were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker\ncould potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer\ncrash. (CVE-2015-6773)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in the DOM implementation in Chromium. If\na user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker\ncould potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer\ncrash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed\nrender process. (CVE-2015-6777)\n\nIt was discovered that the Document::open function in Chromium did not\nensure that page-dismissal event handling is compatible with modal dialog\nblocking. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\nwebsite, an attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof application\nUI content. (CVE-2015-6782)\n\nIt was discovered that the page serializer in Chromium mishandled MOTW\ncomments for URLs in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially\nexploit this to inject HTML content. (CVE-2015-6784)\n\nIt was discovered that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation\nin Chromium accepted an x.y hostname as a match for a *.x.y pattern. An\nattacker could potentially exploit this to bypass intended access\nrestrictions. (CVE-2015-6785)\n\nIt was discovered that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation\nin Chromium accepted blob:, data: and filesystem: URLs as a match for a\n* pattern. An attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass intended\naccess restrictions. (CVE-2015-6786)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial\nof service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-6787)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked\nin to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\nexploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via\nrenderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nsandboxed render process.
