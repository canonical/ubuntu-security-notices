  "details": "It was discovered that the JPEGImageReader class in OpenJDK would\nincorrectly read unused image data. An attacker could use this to\nspecially construct a jpeg image file that when opened by a Java\napplication would cause a denial of service. (CVE-2017-10053)\n\nIt was discovered that the JAR verifier in OpenJDK did not properly\nhandle archives containing files missing digests. An attacker could\nuse this to modify the signed contents of a JAR file. (CVE-2017-10067)\n\nIt was discovered that integer overflows existed in the Hotspot\ncomponent of OpenJDK when generating range check loop predicates. An\nattacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted Java\napplication or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions\nand cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2017-10074)\n\nIt was discovered that the JavaScript Scripting component of OpenJDK\nincorrectly allowed access to Java APIs. An attacker could use this\nto specially craft JavaScript code to bypass access restrictions.\n(CVE-2017-10078)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly process parentheses\nin function signatures. An attacker could use this to specially\nconstruct an untrusted Java application or applet that could escape\nsandbox restrictions. (CVE-2017-10081)\n\nIt was discovered that the ThreadPoolExecutor class in OpenJDK did not\nproperly perform access control checks when cleaning up threads. An\nattacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted Java\napplication or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions and\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-10087)\n\nIt was discovered that the ServiceRegistry implementation\nin OpenJDK did not perform access control checks in certain\nsituations. An attacker could use this to specially construct\nan untrusted Java application or applet that escaped sandbox\nrestrictions. (CVE-2017-10089)\n\nIt was discovered that the channel groups implementation in\nOpenJDK did not properly perform access control checks in some\nsituations. An attacker could use this to specially construct an\nuntrusted Java application or applet that could escape sandbox\nrestrictions. (CVE-2017-10090)\n\nIt was discovered that the DTM exception handling code in the\nJAXP component of OpenJDK did not properly perform access control\nchecks. An attacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted\nJava application or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions.\n(CVE-2017-10096)\n\nIt was discovered that the JAXP component of OpenJDK incorrectly\ngranted access to some internal resolvers. An attacker could use this\nto specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet that\ncould escape sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2017-10101)\n\nIt was discovered that the Distributed Garbage Collector (DGC) in\nOpenJDK did not properly track references in some situations. A\nremote attacker could possibly use this to execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2017-10102)\n\nIt was discovered that the Activation ID implementation in the RMI\ncomponent of OpenJDK did not properly check access control permissions\nin some situations. An attacker could use this to specially construct\nan untrusted Java application or applet that could escape sandbox\nrestrictions. (CVE-2017-10107)\n\nIt was discovered that the BasicAttribute class in OpenJDK did not\nproperly bound memory allocation when de-serializing objects. An\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory\nconsumption). (CVE-2017-10108)\n\nIt was discovered that the CodeSource class in OpenJDK did not\nproperly bound memory allocations when de-serializing object\ninstances. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(memory consumption). (CVE-2017-10109)\n\nIt was discovered that the AWT ImageWatched class in OpenJDK did not\nproperly perform access control checks, An attacker could use this\nto specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet that\ncould escape sandbox restrictions (CVE-2017-10110)\n\nJackson Davis discovered that the LambdaFormEditor class in the\nLibraries component of OpenJDK did not correctly perform bounds checks\nin the permuteArgumentsForm() function. An attacker could use this\nto specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet that\ncould escape sandbox restrictions and possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2017-10111)\n\nIt was discovered that a timing side-channel vulnerability existed\nin the DSA implementation in OpenJDK. An attacker could use this to\nexpose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-10115)\n\nIt was discovered that the LDAP implementation in OpenJDK incorrectly\nfollowed references to non-LDAP URLs. An attacker could use this to\nspecially craft an LDAP referral URL that exposes sensitive information\nor bypass access restrictions. (CVE-2017-10116)\n\nIt was discovered that a timing side-channel vulnerability existed\nin the ECDSA implementation in OpenJDK. An attacker could use this\nto expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-10118)\n\nIlya Maykov discovered that a timing side-channel vulnerability\nexisted in the PKCS#8 implementation in OpenJDK. An attacker could\nuse this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-10135)\n\nIt was discovered that the Elliptic Curve (EC) implementation\nin OpenJDK did not properly compute certain elliptic curve\npoints. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2017-10176)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly restrict weak key\nsizes in some situations. An attacker could use this to specially\nconstruct an untrusted Java application or applet that could escape\nsandbox restrictions. (CVE-2017-10193)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly enforce disabled\nalgorithm restrictions on X.509 certificate chains. An attacker\ncould use this to expose sensitive information or escape sandbox\nrestrictions. (CVE-2017-10198)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly perform access control\nchecks when handling Web Service Definition Language (WSDL) XML\ndocuments. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2017-10243)\n\n",
