  "details": "Yiqi Sun and Kevin Wang discovered that the cgroups implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly restrict access to the cgroups v1\nrelease_agent feature. A local attacker could use this to gain\nadministrative privileges. (CVE-2022-0492)\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Gro\u00df discovered that the Xen subsystem within the Linux kernel did\nnot adequately limit the number of events driver domains (unprivileged PV\nbackends) could send to other guest VMs. An attacker in a driver domain\ncould use this to cause a denial of service in other guest VMs.\n(CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Gro\u00df discovered that the Xen network backend driver in the Linux\nkernel did not adequately limit the amount of queued packets when a guest\ndid not process them. An attacker in a guest VM can use this to cause a\ndenial of service (excessive kernel memory consumption) in the network\nbackend domain. (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)\n\nIt was discovered that the simulated networking device driver for the Linux\nkernel did not properly initialize memory in certain situations. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2021-4135)\n\nBrendan Dolan-Gavitt discovered that the Marvell WiFi-Ex USB device driver\nin the Linux kernel did not properly handle some error conditions. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2021-43976)\n\nIt was discovered that the ARM Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)\nsubsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition leading to a use-\nafter-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-44733)\n\nIt was discovered that the Phone Network protocol (PhoNet) implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some\nerror conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a\ndenial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-45095)\n\nIt was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in\nsome error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a\ndenial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-45480)\n\nSamuel Page discovered that the Transparent Inter-Process Communication\n(TIPC) protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a stack-based\nbuffer overflow. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) for systems that have a TIPC bearer configured.\n(CVE-2022-0435)\n\nIt was discovered that the KVM implementation for s390 systems in the Linux\nkernel did not properly prevent memory operations on PVM guests that were\nin non-protected mode. A local attacker could use this to obtain\nunauthorized memory write access. (CVE-2022-0516)\n",
