This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux\nHardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for Ubuntu\n12.04 ESM.\n\nIt was discovered that the stack guard page for processes in the Linux\nkernel was not sufficiently large enough to prevent overlapping with the\nheap. An attacker could leverage this with another vulnerability to execute\narbitrary code and gain administrative privileges\n",
