  "summary": "lxc regression",
  "details": "USN-2753-1 fixed a vulnerability in LXC. The update caused a regression\nthat prevented some containers from starting. This regression only\naffected containers that had a path that contained a '/./' directory\nspecified as a bind mount target in their configuration file. This\nupdate fixes the problem. We apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Roman Fiedler discovered a directory traversal flaw in lxc-start. A local\n attacker with access to an LXC container could exploit this flaw to run\n programs inside the container that are not confined by AppArmor or expose\n unintended files in the host to the container.\n",
