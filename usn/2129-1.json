  "description": "An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel when inotify is used\nto monitor the /dev/ptmx device. A local user could exploit this flaw to\ndiscover keystroke timing and potentially discover sensitive information\nlike password length. (CVE-2013-0160)\n\nVasily Kulikov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's implementation of\nptrace. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain\nsensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2013-2929)\n\nAndrew Honig reported a flaw in the Linux Kernel's kvm_vm_ioctl_create_vcpu\nfunction of the Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) subsystem. A local user could\nexploit this flaw to gain privileges on the host machine. (CVE-2013-4587)\n\nAndrew Honig reported a flaw in the apic_get_tmcct function of the Kernel\nVirtual Machine (KVM) subsystem if the Linux kernel. A guest OS user could\nexploit this flaw to cause a denial of service or host OS system crash.\n(CVE-2013-6367)\n\nNico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the driver for Adaptec\nAACRAID scsi raid devices in the Linux kernel. A local user could use this\nflaw to cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified impact.\n(CVE-2013-6380)\n\nNico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported buffer underflow errors in the\nimplementation of the XFS filesystem in the Linux kernel. A local user with\nCAP_SYS_ADMIN could exploit these flaw to cause a denial of service (memory\ncorruption) or possibly other unspecified issues. (CVE-2013-6382)\n\nEvan Huus reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's radiotap header\nparsing. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over-\nread) via a specially crafted header. (CVE-2013-7027)\n\nAn information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg\nsystemcalls when used with ISDN sockets in the Linux kernel. A local user\ncould exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information from\nkernel memory. (CVE-2013-7266)\n\nAn information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg\nsystemcalls when used with apple talk sockets in the Linux kernel. A local\nuser could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information\nfrom kernel memory. (CVE-2013-7267)\n\nAn information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg\nsystemcalls when used with ipx protocol sockets in the Linux kernel. A\nlocal user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive\ninformation from kernel memory. (CVE-2013-7268)\n\nAn information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg\nsystemcalls when used with the netrom address family in the Linux kernel. A\nlocal user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive\ninformation from kernel memory. (CVE-2013-7269)\n\nAn information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg\nsystemcalls when used with packet address family sockets in the Linux\nkernel. A local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially\nsensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2013-7270)\n\nAn information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg\nsystemcalls when used with x25 protocol sockets in the Linux kernel. A\nlocal user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive\ninformation from kernel memory. (CVE-2013-7271)\n\nAn information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's SIOCWANDEV ioctl\ncall. A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could exploit this\nflaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.\n(CVE-2014-1444)\n\nAn information leak was discovered in the wanxl ioctl function the\nLinux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially\nsensitive information from kernel memory. (CVE-2014-1445)\n\nAn information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's hamradio YAM\ndriver for AX.25 packet radio. A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN\ncapability could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from\nkernel memory. (CVE-2014-1446)\n\nMatthew Thode reported a denial of service vulnerability in the Linux\nkernel when SELinux support is enabled. A local user with the CAP_MAC_ADMIN\ncapability (and the SELinux mac_admin permission if running in enforcing\nmode) could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel crash).\n(CVE-2014-1874)\n",

If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version.
