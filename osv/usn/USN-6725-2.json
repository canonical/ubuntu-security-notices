  "details": "Chih-Yen Chang discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate certain data structure fields when parsing lease\ncontexts, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexpose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-1194)\n\nQuentin Minster discovered that a race condition existed in the KSMBD\nimplementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-32254)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the KSMBD implementation\nin the Linux kernel when handling session connections, leading to a use-\nafter-free vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-32258)\n\nIt was discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly validate buffer sizes in certain operations, leading to an integer\nunderflow and out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2023-38427)\n\nChih-Yen Chang discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate SMB request protocol IDs, leading to a out-of-\nbounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-38430)\n\nChih-Yen Chang discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate packet header sizes in certain situations,\nleading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2023-38431)\n\nIt was discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle session setup requests, leading to an out-of-bounds read\nvulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2023-3867)\n\nPratyush Yadav discovered that the Xen network backend implementation in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly handle zero length data request, leading\nto a null pointer dereference vulnerability. An attacker in a guest VM\ncould possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host domain crash).\n(CVE-2023-46838)\n\nIt was discovered that the IPv6 implementation of the Linux kernel did not\nproperly manage route cache memory usage. A remote attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2023-52340)\n\nIt was discovered that the device mapper driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly validate target size during certain memory allocations. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2023-52429, CVE-2024-23851)\n\nYang Chaoming discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate request buffer sizes, leading to an out-of-bounds\nread vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2024-22705)\n\nChenyuan Yang discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle read operations on newly created subvolumes in certain\nconditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2024-23850)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Bluetooth subsystem\nin the Linux kernel, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. A\nprivileged local attacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2024-24860)\n\nSeveral security issues were discovered in the Linux kernel.\nAn attacker could possibly use these to compromise the system.\nThis update corrects flaws in the following subsystems:\n  - Architecture specifics;\n  - Block layer;\n  - Cryptographic API;\n  - Android drivers;\n  - EDAC drivers;\n  - GPU drivers;\n  - Media drivers;\n  - Multifunction device drivers;\n  - MTD block device drivers;\n  - Network drivers;\n  - NVME drivers;\n  - TTY drivers;\n  - Userspace I/O drivers;\n  - EFI Variable file system;\n  - F2FS file system;\n  - GFS2 file system;\n  - SMB network file system;\n  - BPF subsystem;\n  - IPv6 Networking;\n  - Network Traffic Control;\n  - AppArmor security module;\n(CVE-2023-52463, CVE-2023-52445, CVE-2023-52462, CVE-2023-52609,\nCVE-2023-52448, CVE-2023-52457, CVE-2023-52464, CVE-2023-52456,\nCVE-2023-52454, CVE-2023-52438, CVE-2023-52480, CVE-2023-52443,\nCVE-2023-52442, CVE-2024-26631, CVE-2023-52439, CVE-2023-52612,\nCVE-2024-26598, CVE-2024-26586, CVE-2024-26589, CVE-2023-52444,\nCVE-2023-52436, CVE-2024-26633, CVE-2024-26597, CVE-2023-52458,\nCVE-2024-26591, CVE-2023-52449, CVE-2023-52467, CVE-2023-52441,\nCVE-2023-52610, CVE-2023-52451, CVE-2023-52469, CVE-2023-52470)\n",
