  "details": "\nA race condition was discovered in the Linux kernel's file_handle size\nverification. A local user could exploit this flaw to read potentially\nsensative memory locations. (CVE-2015-1420)\n\nA underflow error was discovered in the Linux kernel's Ozmo Devices USB\nover WiFi host controller driver. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially execute\narbitrary code via a specially crafted packet. (CVE-2015-4001)\n\nA bounds check error was discovered in the Linux kernel's Ozmo Devices USB\nover WiFi host controller driver. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially execute\narbitrary code via a specially crafted packet. (CVE-2015-4002)\n\nA division by zero error was discovered in the Linux kernel's Ozmo Devices\nUSB over WiFi host controller driver. A remote attacker could exploit this\nflaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-4003)\n\nCarl H Lunde discovered missing consistency checks in the Linux kernel's UDF\nfile system (CONFIG_UDF_FS). A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause\na denial of service (system crash) by using a corrupted file system image.\n(CVE-2015-4167)\n\nDaniel Borkmann reported a kernel crash in the Linux kernel's BPF filter\nJIT optimization. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-4700)\n\nA double free flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's path lookup. A\nlocal user could cause a denial of service (Oops). (CVE-2015-5706)\n",
