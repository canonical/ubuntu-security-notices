A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory\nexhaustion).

A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory\nexhaustion). (CVE-2019-19054)\n\nIt was discovered that the VFIO PCI driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle attempts to access disabled memory spaces. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2020-12888)\n\nIt was discovered that the state of network RNG in the Linux kernel was\npotentially observable. A remote attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2020-16166)\n\nIt was discovered that the NFS client implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly perform bounds checking before copying security labels in\nsome situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-25212)\n",
