  "id": "USN-4391-1",
  "summary": "linux, linux-aws, linux-kvm, linux-raspi2, linux-snapdragon vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle setxattr operations in some situations. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-19319)\n\nIt was discovered that memory contents previously stored in\nmicroarchitectural special registers after RDRAND, RDSEED, and SGX EGETKEY\nread operations on Intel client and Xeon E3 processors may be briefly\nexposed to processes on the same or different processor cores. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-0543)\n\nPiotr Krysiuk discovered that race conditions existed in the file system\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-12114)\n\nIt was discovered that the USB susbsystem's scatter-gather implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not properly take data references in some\nsituations, leading to a use-after-free. A physically proximate attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-12464)\n\nIt was discovered that the DesignWare SPI controller driver in the Linux\nkernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could possibly use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-12769)\n\nIt was discovered that the exit signaling implementation in the Linux\nkernel contained an integer overflow. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (arbitrary application crash). (CVE-2020-12826)\n\nXiumei Mu discovered that the IPSec implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly encrypt IPv6 traffic in some situations. An attacker could use\nthis to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-1749)\n\nDmitry Vyukov discovered that the SELinux netlink security hook in the\nLinux kernel did not validate messages in some situations. A privileged\nattacker could use this to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.\n(CVE-2020-10751)\n",
