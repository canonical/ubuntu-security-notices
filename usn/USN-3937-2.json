A remote attacker with valid credentials could\n possibly use this issue to authenticate using another username, bypassing\n access control restrictions. (CVE-2019-0217)\n\n Alex Nichols and Jakob Hirsch discovered that the Apache HTTP Server mod_authnz_ldap\n module incorrectly handled missing charset encoding headers. A remote attacker\n could possibly use this issue to cause the server to crash, resulting in a denial of\n service. (CVE-2017-15710)\n\n Robert Swiecki discovered that the Apache HTTP Server incorrectly handled\n certain requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause\n the server to crash, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2018-1301)\n\n Nicolas Daniels discovered that the Apache HTTP Server incorrectly generated\n the nonce when creating HTTP Digest authentication challenges. A remote attacker\n could possibly use this issue to replay HTTP requests across a cluster of servers.\n (CVE-2018-1312)\n",
