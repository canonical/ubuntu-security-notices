  "details": "USN-3523-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 17.10.\nThis update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux\nHardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 17.10 for Ubuntu\n16.04 LTS.\n\nJann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution\nand indirect branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory reads via\nsidechannel attacks. This flaw is known as Meltdown. A local attacker could\nuse this to expose sensitive information, including kernel memory.\n(CVE-2017-5754)\n\nJann Horn discovered that the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not properly check the relationship between pointer\nvalues and the BPF stack. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2017-17863)\n\nJann Horn discovered that the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) implementation\nin the Linux kernel improperly performed sign extension in some situations.\nA local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-16995)\n\nAlexei Starovoitov discovered that the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF)\nimplementation in the Linux kernel contained a branch-pruning logic issue\naround unreachable code. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service. (CVE-2017-17862)\n\nJann Horn discovered that the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) implementation\nin the Linux kernel mishandled pointer data values in some situations. A\nlocal attacker could use this to to expose sensitive information (kernel\nmemory). (CVE-2017-17864)\n",
