  "details": "USN-3777-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04\n%LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the\nLinux kernel for Azure Cloud systems.\n\nJann Horn discovered that the vmacache subsystem did not properly handle\nsequence number overflows, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-17182)\n\nIt was discovered that the paravirtualization implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle some indirect calls, reducing the\neffectiveness of Spectre v2 mitigations for paravirtual guests. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-15594)\n\nIt was discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and\nprediction of return addresses via Return Stack Buffer (RSB) may allow\nunauthorized memory reads via sidechannel attacks. An attacker could use\nthis to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-15572)\n\nJann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution\nand branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel\nattacks. This flaw is known as Spectre. A local attacker could use this to\nexpose sensitive information, including kernel memory. (CVE-2017-5715)\n\nIt was discovered that a stack-based buffer overflow existed in the iSCSI\ntarget implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-14633)\n\nJann Horn and Ken Johnson discovered that microprocessors utilizing\nspeculative execution of a memory read may allow unauthorized memory reads\nvia a sidechannel attack. This flaw is known as Spectre Variant 4. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel\nmemory. (CVE-2018-3639)\n\nIt was discovered that a memory leak existed in the IRDA subsystem of the\nLinux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2018-6554)\n\nIt was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the IRDA\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2018-6555)\n",
