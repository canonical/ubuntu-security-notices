  "summary": "linux, linux-aws, linux-azure, linux-gcp, linux-gke, linux-ibm, linux-kvm, linux-lowlatency, linux-oracle, linux-raspi vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly prevent writes to kernel objects in BPF_BTF_LOAD commands. A\nprivileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-0500)\n\nIt was discovered that the Marvell NFC device driver implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly perform memory cleanup operations in some\nsituations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker\ncould possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1734)\n\nYongkang Jia discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle guest TLB mapping invalidation requests in\nsome situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) in the host OS. (CVE-2022-1789)\n\nDuoming Zhou discovered a race condition in the NFC subsystem in the Linux\nkernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A privileged local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1974)\n\nDuoming Zhou discovered that the NFC subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly prevent context switches from occurring during certain atomic\ncontext operations. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-1975)\n\nMinh Yuan discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel contained a\nrace condition in some situations, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-33981)\n",
