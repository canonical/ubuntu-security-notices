  "id": "CVE-2024-29894",
  "details": "Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework. Versions of Cacti prior to 1.2.27 contain a residual cross-site scripting vulnerability caused by an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-50250. `raise_message_javascript` from `lib/functions.php` now uses purify.js to fix CVE-2023-50250 (among others). However, it still generates the code out of unescaped PHP variables `$title` and `$header`. If those variables contain single quotes, they can be used to inject JavaScript code. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could execute actions on behalf of other users. This ability to impersonate users could lead to unauthorized changes to settings. Version 1.2.27 fixes this issue.",
