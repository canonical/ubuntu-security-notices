  "description": "Charles Morris discovered a privilege escalation vulnerability in\nsudo.  On executing Perl scripts with sudo, various environment\nvariables that affect Perl's library search path were not cleaned\nproperly. If sudo is set up to grant limited sudo execution of Perl\nscripts to normal users, this could be exploited to run arbitrary\ncommands as the target user.\n\nThis security update also filters out environment variables that can\nbe exploited similarly with Python, Ruby, and zsh scripts.\n\nPlease note that this does not affect the default Ubuntu installation,\nor any setup that just grants full root privileges to certain users.",
