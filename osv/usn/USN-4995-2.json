  "details": "USN-4995-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Thunderbird. This update provides\nthe corresponding updates for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were\n tricked into opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context, an\n attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service,\n obtain sensitive information, spoof the UI, bypass security restrictions,\n or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-23961, CVE-2021-23981,\n CVE-2021-23982, CVE-2021-23987, CVE-2021-23994, CVE-2021-23998,\n CVE-2021-23999, CVE-2021-29945, CVE-2021-29946, CVE-2021-29967)\n \n It was discovered that extensions could open popup windows with control\n of the window title in some circumstances. If a user were tricked into\n installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker could potentially\n exploit this to spoof a website and trick the user into providing\n credentials. (CVE-2021-23984)\n \n Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird's OpenPGP\n integration. If a user were tricked into importing a specially crafted\n key in some circumstances, an attacker could potentially exploit this\n to cause a denial of service (inability to send encrypted email) or\n confuse the user. (CVE-2021-23991, CVE-2021-23992, CVE-2021-23993)\n \n A use-after-free was discovered when Responsive Design Mode was\n enabled. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted\n website with Responsive Design Mode enabled, an attacker could\n potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service, or execute\n arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-23995)\n \n It was discovered that Thunderbird mishandled ftp URLs with encoded\n newline characters. If a user were tricked into clicking on a specially\n crafted link, an attacker could potentially exploit this to send arbitrary\n FTP commands. (CVE-2021-24002)\n \n It was discovered that Thunderbird wrote signatures to disk and read them\n back during verification. A local attacker could potentially exploit this\n to replace the data with another signature file. (CVE-2021-29948)\n \n It was discovered that Thunderbird might load an alternative OTR\n library. If a user were tricked into copying a specially crafted\n library to one of Thunderbird's search paths, an attacker could\n potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-29949)\n \n It was discovered that secret keys imported into Thunderbird were\n stored unencrypted. A local attacker could potentially exploit this to\n obtain private keys. (CVE-2021-29956)\n \n It was discovered that Thunderbird did not indicate when an inline signed\n or encrypted message contained additional unprotected parts.\n (CVE-2021-29957)\n",
