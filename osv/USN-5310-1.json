  "details": "Jan Engelhardt, Tavis Ormandy, and others discovered that the GNU C Library\niconv feature incorrectly handled certain input sequences. An attacker\ncould possibly use this issue to cause the GNU C Library to hang or crash,\nresulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS\nand Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2016-10228, CVE-2019-25013, CVE-2020-27618,\nCVE-2020-29562, CVE-2021-3326)\n\nJason Royes and Samuel Dytrych discovered that the GNU C Library\nincorrectly handled signed comparisons on ARMv7 targets. A remote attacker\ncould use this issue to cause the GNU C Library to crash, resulting in a\ndenial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only\naffected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2020-6096)\n\nIt was discovered that the GNU C Library nscd daemon incorrectly handled\ncertain netgroup lookups. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\ncause the GNU C Library to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This\nissue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2021-27645)\n\nIt was discovered that the GNU C Library wordexp function incorrectly\nhandled certain patterns. An attacker could use this issue to cause the\nGNU C Library to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly\nobtain sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and\nUbuntu 20.04 LTS. (CVE-2021-35942)\n\nIt was discovered that the GNU C Library realpath function incorrectly\nhandled return values. An attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain\nsensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 21.10.\n(CVE-2021-3998)\n\nIt was discovered that the GNU C library getcwd function incorrectly\nhandled buffers. An attacker could use this issue to cause the GNU C\nLibrary to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3999)\n\nIt was discovered that the GNU C Library sunrpc module incorrectly handled\nbuffer lengths. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause the GNU\nC Library to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2022-23218,\nCVE-2022-23219)\n",
