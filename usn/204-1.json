  "description": "Yutaka Oiwa discovered a possible cryptographic weakness in OpenSSL\napplications. Applications using the OpenSSL library can use the\nSSL_OP_MSIE_SSLV2_RSA_PADDING option (or SSL_OP_ALL, which implies the\nformer) to maintain compatibility with third party products, which is\nachieved by working around known bugs in them.\n\nThe SSL_OP_MSIE_SSLV2_RSA_PADDING option disabled a verification step\nin the SSL 2.0 server supposed to prevent active protocol-version\nrollback attacks.  With this verification step disabled, an attacker\nacting as a \"machine-in-the-middle\" could force a client and a server to\nnegotiate the SSL 2.0 protocol even if these parties both supported\nSSL 3.0 or TLS 1.0.  The SSL 2.0 protocol is known to have severe\ncryptographic weaknesses and is supported as a fallback only.",
