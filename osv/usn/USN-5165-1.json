  "summary": "linux-oem-5.14 vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the NFC subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a\nuse-after-free vulnerability in its NFC Controller Interface (NCI)\nimplementation. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3760)\n\nIt was discovered that the SCTP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly verify VTAGs in some situations. A remote attacker could\npossibly use this to cause a denial of service (connection disassociation).\n(CVE-2021-3772)\n\nIt was discovered that the AMD Radeon GPU driver in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly validate writes in the debugfs file system. A privileged\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-42327)\n\nLuo Likang discovered that the FireDTV Firewire driver in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-42739)\n\nIt was discovered that the KVM implementation for POWER8 processors in the\nLinux kernel did not properly keep track if a wakeup event could be\nresolved by a guest. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to\ncause a denial of service (host OS crash). (CVE-2021-43056)\n\nIt was discovered that the TIPC Protocol implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate MSG_CRYPTO messages in some situations. An\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-43267)\n\nIt was discovered that the ISDN CAPI implementation in the Linux kernel\ncontained a race condition in certain situations that could trigger an\narray out-of-bounds bug. A privileged local attacker could possibly use\nthis to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2021-43389)\n\n",
