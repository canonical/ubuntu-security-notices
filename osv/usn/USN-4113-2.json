  "details": "USN-4113-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Apache HTTP server.\nUnfortunately, that update introduced a regression when proxying\nbalancer manager connections in some configurations. This update\nfixes the problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Stefan Eissing discovered that the HTTP/2 implementation in Apache\n did not properly handle upgrade requests from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 in\n some situations. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial\n of service (daemon crash). This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS\n and Ubuntu 19.04. (CVE-2019-0197)\n\n Craig Young discovered that a memory overwrite error existed in\n Apache when performing HTTP/2 very early pushes in some situations. A\n remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (daemon\n crash). This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 19.04.\n (CVE-2019-10081)\n\n Craig Young discovered that a read-after-free error existed in the\n HTTP/2 implementation in Apache during connection shutdown. A remote\n attacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of service (daemon\n crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. This issue only\n affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 19.04. (CVE-2019-10082)\n\n Matei Badanoiu discovered that the mod_proxy component of\n Apache did not properly filter URLs when reporting errors in some\n configurations. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to\n conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2019-10092)\n\n Daniel McCarney discovered that mod_remoteip component of Apache\n contained a stack buffer overflow when parsing headers from a trusted\n intermediary proxy in some situations. A remote attacker controlling a\n trusted proxy could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly\n execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 19.04.\n (CVE-2019-10097)\n\n Yukitsugu Sasaki discovered that the mod_rewrite component in Apache\n was vulnerable to open redirects in some situations. A remote attacker\n could use this to possibly expose sensitive information or bypass\n intended restrictions. (CVE-2019-10098)\n\n Jonathan Looney discovered that the HTTP/2 implementation in Apache did\n not properly limit the amount of buffering for client connections in\n some situations. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial\n of service (unresponsive daemon). This issue only affected Ubuntu\n 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 19.04. (CVE-2019-9517)\n",
