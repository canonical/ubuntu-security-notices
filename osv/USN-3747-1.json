  "details": "It was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly validate types in some\nsituations. An attacker could use this to construct a Java class that could\npossibly bypass sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2018-2825, CVE-2018-2826)\n\nIt was discovered that the PatternSyntaxException class in OpenJDK did not\nproperly validate arguments passed to it. An attacker could use this to\npotentially construct a class that caused a denial of service (excessive\nmemory consumption). (CVE-2018-2952)\n\nDaniel Bleichenbacher discovered a vulnerability in the Galois/Counter Mode\n(GCM) mode of operation for symmetric block ciphers in OpenJDK. An attacker\ncould use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-2972)\n",
