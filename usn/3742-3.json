  "description": "USN-3742-2 introduced mitigations in the Linux Hardware Enablement\n(HWE) kernel for Ubuntu 12.04 ESM to address L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF)\nvulnerabilities (CVE-2018-3620, CVE-2018-3646). Unfortunately, the\nupdate introduced regressions that caused kernel panics when booting\nin some environments as well as preventing Java applications from\nstarting. This update fixes the problems.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU\n core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU\n core. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local\n attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to expose sensitive\n information (memory from other guests or the host OS). (CVE-2018-3646)\n\n It was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU\n core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU\n core. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local\n attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (memory from the\n kernel or other processes). (CVE-2018-3620)\n\n Andrey Konovalov discovered an out-of-bounds read in the POSIX\n timers subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use\n this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive\n information. (CVE-2017-18344)\n\n Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel\n performed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when\n handling incoming packets. A remote attacker could use this to cause a\n denial of service. (CVE-2018-5390)\n\n Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that the IP implementation in the Linux kernel\n performed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when\n handling incoming packet fragments. A remote attacker could use this to\n cause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-5391)\n",
