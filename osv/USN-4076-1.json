  "summary": "linux, linux-aws, linux-kvm, linux-raspi2 vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Serial Attached SCSI\n(SAS) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2018-20836)\n\nIt was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly zero out memory in some situations. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2019-11833)\n\nIt was discovered that the Bluetooth Human Interface Device Protocol (HIDP)\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not properly verify strings were\nNULL terminated in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to\nexpose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-11884)\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel on ARM processors allowed a tracing\nprocess to modify a syscall after a seccomp decision had been made on that\nsyscall. A local attacker could possibly use this to bypass seccomp\nrestrictions. (CVE-2019-2054)\n\nHugues Anguelkov discovered that the Broadcom Wifi driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly prevent remote firmware events from being processed\nfor USB Wifi devices. A physically proximate attacker could use this to\nsend firmware events to the device. (CVE-2019-9503)\n\nIt was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the Freescale\n(PowerPC) hypervisor manager in the Linux kernel. A local attacker with\nwrite access to /dev/fsl-hv could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-10142)\n",
