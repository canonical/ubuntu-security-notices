An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-1000001)  It was discovered that musl did not properly handle the parsing of DNS response codes. A remote attacker could use this vulnerability to cause resource consumption (infinite loop), denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM. (CVE-2014-3484)  It was discovered that musl did not properly handle the parsing of DNS response codes. A remote attacker could use this vulnerability to cause resource consumption (infinite loop), denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 ESM. (CVE-2017-15650)  It was discovered that musl did not properly handle the parsing of ipv6 addresses. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 ESM. (CVE-2015-1817)  It was discovered that TRE library, used by musl, did not properly handle certain inputs. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (crash).
