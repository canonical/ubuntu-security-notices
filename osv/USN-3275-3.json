  "details": "USN-3275-2 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenJDK 7. Unfortunately, the\nupdate introduced a regression when handling TLS handshakes. This\nupdate fixes the problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that OpenJDK improperly re-used cached NTLM\n connections in some situations. A remote attacker could possibly\n use this to cause a Java application to perform actions with the\n credentials of a different user. (CVE-2017-3509)\n\n It was discovered that an untrusted library search path flaw existed\n in the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) component of OpenJDK. A\n local attacker could possibly use this to gain the privileges of a\n Java application. (CVE-2017-3511)\n\n It was discovered that the Java API for XML Processing (JAXP) component\n in OpenJDK did not properly enforce size limits when parsing XML\n documents. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n (processor and memory consumption). (CVE-2017-3526)\n\n It was discovered that the FTP client implementation in OpenJDK did\n not properly sanitize user inputs. If a user was tricked into opening\n a specially crafted FTP URL, a remote attacker could use this to\n manipulate the FTP connection. (CVE-2017-3533)\n\n It was discovered that OpenJDK allowed MD5 to be used as an algorithm\n for JAR integrity verification. An attacker could possibly use this\n to modify the contents of a JAR file without detection. (CVE-2017-3539)\n\n It was discovered that the SMTP client implementation in OpenJDK\n did not properly sanitize sender and recipient addresses. A remote\n attacker could use this to specially craft email addresses and gain\n control of a Java application's SMTP connections. (CVE-2017-3544)\n",
