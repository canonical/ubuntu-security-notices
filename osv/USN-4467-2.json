  "details": "USN-4467-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in QEMU. This update provides\nthe corresponding update for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that the QEMU SD memory card implementation incorrectly\n handled certain memory operations. An attacker inside a guest could\n possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of\n service. (CVE-2020-13253)\n\n Ren Ding and Hanqing Zhao discovered that the QEMU ES1370 audio driver\n incorrectly handled certain invalid frame counts. An attacker inside a\n guest could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a\n denial of service. (CVE-2020-13361)\n\n Ren Ding and Hanqing Zhao discovered that the QEMU MegaRAID SAS SCSI driver\n incorrectly handled certain memory operations. An attacker inside a guest\n could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial\n of service. (CVE-2020-13362)\n\n Alexander Bulekov discovered that QEMU MegaRAID SAS SCSI driver incorrectly\n handled certain memory space operations. An attacker inside a guest could\n possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of\n service. (CVE-2020-13659)\n\n Ren Ding, Hanqing Zhao, Alexander Bulekov, and Anatoly Trosinenko\n discovered that the QEMU incorrectly handled certain msi-x mmio operations.\n An attacker inside a guest could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to\n crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2020-13754)\n\n Ziming Zhang, Xiao Wei, Gonglei Arei and Yanyu Zhang discovered that\n QEMU incorrectly handled certain USB packets. An attacker could possibly\n use this to expose sensitive information or execute arbitrary code.\n (CVE-2020-14364)\n",
