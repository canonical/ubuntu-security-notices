A remote attacker could use this\nflaw to cause the Tomcat server to consume resources, resulting in a denial\nof service. (CVE-2014-0075)\n\nIt was discovered that Tomcat did not properly restrict XSLT stylesheets.\nAn attacker could use this issue with a crafted web application to bypass\nsecurity-manager restrictions and read arbitrary files. (CVE-2014-0096)\n\nIt was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly handled certain Content-Length\nheaders. A remote attacker could use this flaw in configurations where\nTomcat is behind a reverse proxy to perform HTTP request smuggling attacks.\n(CVE-2014-0099)\n",
