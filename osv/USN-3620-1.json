  "details": "It was discovered that the netlink 802.11 configuration interface in the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate some attributes passed from\nuserspace. A local attacker with the CAP_NET_ADMIN privilege could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2017-11089)\n\nIt was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ioctl handling code\nin the ISDN subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2017-12762)\n\nIt was discovered that the netfilter component of the Linux did not\nproperly restrict access to the connection tracking helpers list. A local\nattacker could use this to bypass intended access restrictions.\n(CVE-2017-17448)\n\nDmitry Vyukov discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel\ncontained an out-of-bounds read when handling memory-mapped I/O. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-17741)\n\nIt was discovered that the Salsa20 encryption algorithm implementations in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly handle zero-length inputs. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2017-17805)\n\nIt was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly check permissions when a key request was performed on a\ntask's default keyring. A local attacker could use this to add keys to\nunauthorized keyrings. (CVE-2017-17807)\n\nIt was discovered that the Broadcom NetXtremeII ethernet driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate Generic Segment Offload (GSO) packet\nsizes. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (interface\nunavailability). (CVE-2018-1000026)\n\nIt was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Socket (RDS) implementation in\nthe Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write during RDMA page\nallocation. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-5332)\n",
