  "summary": "linux, linux-aws, linux-kvm, linux-raspi2, linux-snapdragon vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that a race condition existed in the GFS2 file system in\nthe Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2016-10905)\n\nIt was discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly validate socket options in some situations. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2017-18509)\n\nIt was discovered that the USB gadget Midi driver in the Linux kernel\ncontained a double-free vulnerability when handling certain error\nconditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2018-20961)\n\nIt was discovered that the XFS file system in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly handle mount failures in some situations. A local attacker could\npossibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2018-20976)\n\nIt was discovered that the Intel Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate certain Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS). A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(Wi-Fi disconnect). (CVE-2019-0136)\n\nIt was discovered that the Bluetooth UART implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly check for missing tty operations. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-10207)\n\nIt was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the Linux kernel when\nreference counting pages, leading to potential use-after-free issues. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-11487)\n\nIt was discovered that the GTCO tablet input driver in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly bounds check the initial HID report sent by the device. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-13631)\n\nIt was discovered that the Raremono AM/FM/SW radio device driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly allocate memory, leading to a use-after-free.\nA physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-15211)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the CPiA2 video4linux\ndevice driver for the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-15215)\n\nIt was discovered that the Atheros mobile chipset driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate data in some situations. An attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15926)\n",
