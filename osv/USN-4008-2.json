  "details": "USN-4008-1 fixed multiple security issues in the Linux kernel. This update\nprovides the corresponding changes to AppArmor policy for correctly\noperating under the Linux kernel with fixes for CVE-2019-11190. Without\nthese changes, some profile transitions may be unintentionally denied due\nto missing mmap ('m') rules.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Robert \u015awi\u0119cki discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly apply\n Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) in some situations for setuid elf\n binaries. A local attacker could use this to improve the chances of\n exploiting an existing vulnerability in a setuid elf binary.\n (CVE-2019-11190)\n \n It was discovered that a null pointer dereference vulnerability existed in\n the LSI Logic MegaRAID driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could\n use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-11810)\n \n It was discovered that a race condition leading to a use-after-free existed\n in the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol implementation in the Linux\n kernel. The RDS protocol is disabled via blocklist by default in Ubuntu. If\n enabled, a local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-11815)\n \n Federico Manuel Bento discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly\n apply Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) in some situations for\n setuid a.out binaries. A local attacker could use this to improve the\n chances of exploiting an existing vulnerability in a setuid a.out binary.\n (CVE-2019-11191)\n \n As a hardening measure, this update disables a.out support.\n",
