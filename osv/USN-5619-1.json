An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of\nservice or to expose sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu\n18.04 LTS.

An attacker could possibly use\nthis issue to cause a denial of service or to expose sensitive information.\nThis issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2020-19144)\n\nIt was discovered that LibTIFF did not properly manage memory under certain\ncircumstances. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted TIFF\nfile using tiffinfo tool, an attacker could possibly use this issue to\ncause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and\nUbuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-1354)\n\nIt was discovered that LibTIFF did not properly manage memory under certain\ncircumstances. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted TIFF\nfile using tiffcp tool, an attacker could possibly use this issue to     \ncause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-1355)\n\nIt was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing checks to avoid\ndivision calculations where the denominator value was zero, which could\nlead to an undefined behaviour situation via a specially crafted file. An\nattacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2022-2056, CVE-2022-2057, CVE-2022-2058)\n",
