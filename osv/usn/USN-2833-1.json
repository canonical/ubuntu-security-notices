  "details": "Andrei Vaida, Jesse Ruderman, Bob Clary, Christian Holler, Jesse Ruderman,\nEric Rahm, Robert Kaiser, Harald Kirschner, and Michael Henretty\ndiscovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application\ncrash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking\nFirefox. (CVE-2015-7201, CVE-2015-7202)\n\nRonald Crane discovered three buffer overflows through code inspection.\nIf a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an\nattacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via\napplication crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nuser invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-7203, CVE-2015-7220, CVE-2015-7221)\n\nCajus Pollmeier discovered a crash during javascript variable assignments\nin some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially\ncrafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.\n(CVE-2015-7204)\n\nRonald Crane discovered a buffer overflow through code inspection. If a\nuser were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker\ncould potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via\napplication crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nuser invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-7205)\n\nIt was discovered that it is possible to read cross-origin URLs following\na redirect if performance.getEntries() is used with an iframe to host a\npage. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an\nattacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin\nrestrictions. (CVE-2015-7207)\n\nIt was discovered that Firefox allows for control characters to be set in\ncookies. An attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cookie\ninjection attacks on some web servers. (CVE-2015-7208)\n\nLooben Yang discovered a use-after-free in WebRTC when closing channels in\nsome circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially\ncrafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a\ndenial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with\nthe privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-7210)\n\nAbdulrahman Alqabandi discovered that hash symbol is incorrectly handled\nwhen parsing data: URLs. An attacker could potentially exploit this to\nconduct URL spoofing attacks. (CVE-2015-7211)\n\nAbhishek Arya discovered an integer overflow when allocating large\ntextures. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\nwebsite, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of\nservice via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-7212)\n\nRonald Crane dicovered an integer overflow when processing MP4 format\nvideo in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a\nspecially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\ncause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code\nwith the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-7213)\n\nTsubasa Iinuma discovered a way to bypass same-origin restrictions using\ndata: and view-source: URLs. If a user were tricked in to opening a\nspecially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\nobtain sensitive information and read local files. (CVE-2015-7214)\n\nMasato Kinugawa discovered a cross-origin information leak in error events\nin web workers. An attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain\nsensitive information. (CVE-2015-7215)\n\nGustavo Grieco discovered that the file chooser crashed on malformed\nimages due to flaws in the Jasper library. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\nexploit this to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2015-7216, CVE-2015-7217)\n\nStuart Larsen discoverd two integer underflows when handling malformed\nHTTP/2 frames in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening\na specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these\nto cause a denial of service via application crash. (CVE-2015-7218,\nCVE-2015-7219)\n\nGerald Squelart discovered an integer underflow in the libstagefright\nlibrary when parsing MP4 format video in some circumstances. If a user\nwere tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application\ncrash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking\nFirefox. (CVE-2015-7222)\n\nKris Maglione discovered a mechanism where web content could use\nWebExtension APIs to execute code with the privileges of a particular\nWebExtension. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\nwebsite with a vulnerable extension installed, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information or conduct\ncross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
