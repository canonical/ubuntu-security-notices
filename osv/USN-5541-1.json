  "details": "Eric Biederman discovered that the cgroup process migration implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not perform permission checks correctly in some\nsituations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain administrative\nprivileges. (CVE-2021-4197)\n\nJann Horn discovered that the FUSE file system in the Linux kernel\ncontained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2022-1011)\n\nDuoming Zhou discovered that the 6pack protocol implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not handle detach events properly in some situations, leading to\na use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-1198)\n\nDuoming Zhou discovered that the AX.25 amateur radio protocol\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not handle detach events properly in\nsome situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1199)\n\nDuoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the AX.25 amateur radio protocol\nimplementation in the Linux kernel during device detach operations. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2022-1204)\n\nDuoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the AX.25 amateur radio protocol\nimplementation in the Linux kernel, leading to use-after-free\nvulnerabilities. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash). (CVE-2022-1205)\n\nIt was discovered that the PF_KEYv2 implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly initialize kernel memory in some situations. A local attacker\ncould use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2022-1353)\n\nIt was discovered that the implementation of X.25 network protocols in the\nLinux kernel did not terminate link layer sessions properly. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2022-1516)\n\nZheyu Ma discovered that the Silicon Motion SM712 framebuffer driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle very small reads. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-2380)\n\nIt was discovered that the 8 Devices USB2CAN interface implementation in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading\nto a double-free. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-28388)\n\nIt was discovered that the Microchip CAN BUS Analyzer interface\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error\nconditions, leading to a double-free. A local attacker could possibly use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-28389)\n",
