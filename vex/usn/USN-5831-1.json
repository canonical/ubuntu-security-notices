                "description": "Kyle Zeng discovered that the sysctl implementation in the Linux kernel contained a stack-based buffer overflow. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-4378)  Tam\u00e1s Koczka discovered that the Bluetooth L2CAP handshake implementation in the Linux kernel contained multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-42896)  It was discovered that the Xen netback driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle packets structured in certain ways. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host NIC availability). (CVE-2022-3643)  It was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the Bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-45934)",
