  "details": "USN-3366-1 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenJDK 8. Unfortunately, that\nupdate introduced a regression that caused some valid JAR files to\nfail validation. This update fixes the problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that the JPEGImageReader class in OpenJDK would\n incorrectly read unused image data. An attacker could use this to\n specially construct a jpeg image file that when opened by a Java\n application would cause a denial of service. (CVE-2017-10053)\n\n It was discovered that the JAR verifier in OpenJDK did not properly\n handle archives containing files missing digests. An attacker could\n use this to modify the signed contents of a JAR file. (CVE-2017-10067)\n\n It was discovered that integer overflows existed in the Hotspot\n component of OpenJDK when generating range check loop predicates. An\n attacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted Java\n application or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions\n and cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary\n code. (CVE-2017-10074)\n\n It was discovered that the JavaScript Scripting component of OpenJDK\n incorrectly allowed access to Java APIs. An attacker could use this\n to specially craft JavaScript code to bypass access restrictions.\n (CVE-2017-10078)\n\n It was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly process parentheses\n in function signatures. An attacker could use this to specially\n construct an untrusted Java application or applet that could escape\n sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2017-10081)\n\n It was discovered that the ThreadPoolExecutor class in OpenJDK did not\n properly perform access control checks when cleaning up threads. An\n attacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted Java\n application or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions and\n possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-10087)\n\n It was discovered that the ServiceRegistry implementation\n in OpenJDK did not perform access control checks in certain\n situations. An attacker could use this to specially construct\n an untrusted Java application or applet that escaped sandbox\n restrictions. (CVE-2017-10089)\n\n It was discovered that the channel groups implementation in\n OpenJDK did not properly perform access control checks in some\n situations. An attacker could use this to specially construct an\n untrusted Java application or applet that could escape sandbox\n restrictions. (CVE-2017-10090)\n\n It was discovered that the DTM exception handling code in the\n JAXP component of OpenJDK did not properly perform access control\n checks. An attacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted\n Java application or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions.\n (CVE-2017-10096)\n\n It was discovered that the JAXP component of OpenJDK incorrectly\n granted access to some internal resolvers. An attacker could use this\n to specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet that\n could escape sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2017-10101)\n\n It was discovered that the Distributed Garbage Collector (DGC) in\n OpenJDK did not properly track references in some situations. A\n remote attacker could possibly use this to execute arbitrary\n code. (CVE-2017-10102)\n\n It was discovered that the Activation ID implementation in the RMI\n component of OpenJDK did not properly check access control permissions\n in some situations. An attacker could use this to specially construct\n an untrusted Java application or applet that could escape sandbox\n restrictions. (CVE-2017-10107)\n\n It was discovered that the BasicAttribute class in OpenJDK did not\n properly bound memory allocation when de-serializing objects. An\n attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory\n consumption). (CVE-2017-10108)\n\n It was discovered that the CodeSource class in OpenJDK did not\n properly bound memory allocations when de-serializing object\n instances. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n (memory consumption). (CVE-2017-10109)\n\n It was discovered that the AWT ImageWatched class in OpenJDK did not\n properly perform access control checks, An attacker could use this\n to specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet that\n could escape sandbox restrictions (CVE-2017-10110)\n\n Jackson Davis discovered that the LambdaFormEditor class in the\n Libraries component of OpenJDK did not correctly perform bounds checks\n in the permuteArgumentsForm() function. An attacker could use this\n to specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet that\n could escape sandbox restrictions and possibly execute arbitrary\n code. (CVE-2017-10111)\n\n It was discovered that a timing side-channel vulnerability existed\n in the DSA implementation in OpenJDK. An attacker could use this to\n expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-10115)\n\n It was discovered that the LDAP implementation in OpenJDK incorrectly\n followed references to non-LDAP URLs. An attacker could use this to\n specially craft an LDAP referral URL that exposes sensitive information\n or bypass access restrictions. (CVE-2017-10116)\n\n It was discovered that a timing side-channel vulnerability existed\n in the ECDSA implementation in OpenJDK. An attacker could use this\n to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-10118)\n\n Ilya Maykov discovered that a timing side-channel vulnerability\n existed in the PKCS#8 implementation in OpenJDK. An attacker could\n use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-10135)\n\n It was discovered that the Elliptic Curve (EC) implementation\n in OpenJDK did not properly compute certain elliptic curve\n points. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive\n information. (CVE-2017-10176)\n\n It was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly restrict weak key\n sizes in some situations. An attacker could use this to specially\n construct an untrusted Java application or applet that could escape\n sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2017-10193)\n\n It was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly enforce disabled\n algorithm restrictions on X.509 certificate chains. An attacker\n could use this to expose sensitive information or escape sandbox\n restrictions. (CVE-2017-10198)\n\n It was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly perform access control\n checks when handling Web Service Definition Language (WSDL) XML\n documents. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.\n (CVE-2017-10243)\n",
