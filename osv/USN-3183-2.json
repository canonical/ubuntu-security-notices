This update provides the corresponding update for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\nand Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Stefan Buehler discovered that GnuTLS incorrectly verified the serial\n length of OCSP responses. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue\n to bypass certain certificate validation measures. This issue only applied\n to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2016-7444)\n \n Shi Lei discovered that GnuTLS incorrectly handled certain warning alerts.\n A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause GnuTLS to hang,\n resulting in a denial of service. This issue has only been addressed in\n Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.10. (CVE-2016-8610)\n \n It was discovered that GnuTLS incorrectly decoded X.509 certificates with a\n Proxy Certificate Information extension.
