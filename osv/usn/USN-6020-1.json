  "details": "It was discovered that the System V IPC implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly handle large shared memory counts. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-3669)\n\nIt was discovered that the KVM VMX implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle indirect branch prediction isolation between L1 and L2\nVMs. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation from the host OS or other guest VMs. (CVE-2022-2196)\n\nGerald Lee discovered that the USB Gadget file system implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free\nvulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause\na denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2022-4382)\n\nIt was discovered that the RNDIS USB driver in the Linux kernel contained\nan integer overflow vulnerability. A local attacker with physical access\ncould plug in a malicious USB device to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-23559)\n\n",
