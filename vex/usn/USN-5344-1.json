An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause DBD::mysql to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-1249, CVE-2016-1251)  It was discovered that the DBD::mysql module was susceptible to an operation that would result in improper memory access, introduced through incorrect documentation and code examples. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause DBD::mysql to crash or potentially cause other, unspecified, impact. (CVE-2017-10788)  It was discovered that the DBD::mysql module processed SSL/TLS settings in a way that did not fully correlate with the respective documentation for each setting. An attacker could possibly use this to perform a cleartext-downgrade attack. (CVE-2017-10789)",
