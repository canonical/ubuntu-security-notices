If a user\nwere tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application\ncrash, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5170)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in the V8 bindings in Blink. If a user\nwere tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application\ncrash, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5171)\n\nAn issue was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a\nspecially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\nontain sensitive information from arbitrary memory locations.\n(CVE-2016-5172)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial\nof service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2016-5175, CVE-2016-5178)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\nexploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5177)\n\nIt was discovered that Chromium does not ensure the recipient of a certain\nIPC message is a valid RenderFrame or RenderWidget. An attacker could\npotentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application\ncrash, or execute arbitary code. (CVE-2016-7549)\n",
