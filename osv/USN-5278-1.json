  "summary": "linux-oem-5.14 vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the rlimit tracking for user namespaces in the Linux\nkernel did not properly perform reference counting, leading to a use-after-\nfree vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-24122)\n\nIt was discovered that the BPF verifier in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly restrict pointer types in certain situations. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-23222)\n\nJeremy Cline discovered a use-after-free in the nouveau graphics driver of\nthe Linux kernel during device removal. A privileged or physically\nproximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2020-27820)\n\nIt was discovered that the Packet network protocol implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a double-free vulnerability. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2021-22600)\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Gro\u00df discovered that the Xen subsystem within the Linux kernel did\nnot adequately limit the number of events driver domains (unprivileged PV\nbackends) could send to other guest VMs. An attacker in a driver domain\ncould use this to cause a denial of service in other guest VMs.\n(CVE-2021-28713)\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Gro\u00df discovered that the Xen network backend driver in the Linux\nkernel did not adequately limit the amount of queued packets when a guest\ndid not process them. An attacker in a guest VM can use this to cause a\ndenial of service (excessive kernel memory consumption) in the network\nbackend domain. (CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715)\n\nSzymon Heidrich discovered that the USB Gadget subsystem in the Linux\nkernel did not properly restrict the size of control requests for certain\ngadget types, leading to possible out of bounds reads or writes. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-39685)\n\nIt was discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel\ncontained a race condition around read-only maps. A privileged attacker\ncould use this to modify read-only maps. (CVE-2021-4001)\n\nJann Horn discovered a race condition in the Unix domain socket\nimplementation in the Linux kernel that could result in a read-after-free.\nA local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-4083)\n\nIt was discovered that the simulated networking device driver for the Linux\nkernel did not properly initialize memory in certain situations. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2021-4135)\n\nKirill Tkhai discovered that the XFS file system implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not calculate size correctly when pre-allocating space in\nsome situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2021-4155)\n\nEric Biederman discovered that the cgroup process migration implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not perform permission checks correctly in some\nsituations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain administrative\nprivileges. (CVE-2021-4197)\n\nBrendan Dolan-Gavitt discovered that the aQuantia AQtion Ethernet device\ndriver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate meta-data coming from\nthe device. A local attacker who can control an emulated device can use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2021-43975)\n\nIt was discovered that the ARM Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)\nsubsystem in the Linux kernel contained a race condition leading to a use-\nafter-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-44733)\n\nIt was discovered that the Phone Network protocol (PhoNet) implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some\nerror conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a\ndenial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-45095)\n\nIt was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in\nsome error conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a\ndenial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-45480)\n\nIt was discovered that the BPF subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly track pointer types on atomic fetch operations in some situations.\nA local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel\npointer addresses). (CVE-2022-0264)\n\nSushma Venkatesh Reddy discovered that the Intel i915 graphics driver in\nthe Linux kernel did not perform a GPU TLB flush in some situations. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-0330)\n\nIt was discovered that the TIPC Protocol implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly initialize memory in some situations. A local attacker\ncould use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).\n(CVE-2022-0382)\n\nIt was discovered that the VMware Virtual GPU driver in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly handle certain failure conditions, leading to a stale\nentry in the file descriptor table. A local attacker could use this to\nexpose sensitive information or possibly gain administrative privileges.\n(CVE-2022-22942)\n",
