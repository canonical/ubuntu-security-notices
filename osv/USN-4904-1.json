  "summary": "linux, linux-aws, linux-kvm, linux-lts-xenial, linux-raspi2, linux-snapdragon vulnerabilities",
  "details": "Ben Harris discovered that the Linux kernel would strip extended privilege\nattributes of files when performing a failed unprivileged system call. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2015-1350)\n\nAndrey Konovalov discovered that the video4linux driver for Hauppauge HD\nPVR USB devices in the Linux kernel did not properly handle some error\nconditions. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2017-16644)\n\nIt was discovered that the timer stats implementation in the Linux kernel\nallowed the discovery of a real PID value while inside a PID namespace. A\nlocal attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2017-5967)\n\nWen Xu discovered that the xfs file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate the number of extents in an inode. An\nattacker could use this to construct a malicious xfs image that, when\nmounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-13095)\n\nIt was discovered that the Fujitsu ES network device driver for the Linux\nkernel did not properly check for errors in some situations, leading to a\nNULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service. (CVE-2019-16231)\n\nIt was discovered that the Marvell 8xxx Libertas WLAN device driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly check for errors in certain situations,\nleading to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use\nthis to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-16232)\n\nIt was discovered that the ADIS16400 IIO IMU Driver for the Linux kernel\ndid not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2019-19061)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the floppy device driver\nin the Linux kernel. An attacker with access to the floppy device could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2021-20261)\n\nOlivier Benjamin, Norbert Manthey, Martin Mazein, and Jan H. Sch\u00f6nherr\ndiscovered that the Xen paravirtualization backend in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly propagate errors to frontend drivers in some situations. An\nattacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service\n(host domain crash). (CVE-2021-26930)\n\nJan Beulich discovered that multiple Xen backends in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle certain error conditions under paravirtualization. An\nattacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service\n(host domain crash). (CVE-2021-26931)\n\nJan Beulich discovered that the Xen netback backend in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle certain error conditions under paravirtualization. An\nattacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service\n(host domain crash). (CVE-2021-28038)\n",
