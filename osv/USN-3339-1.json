  "details": "Karthikeyan Bhargavan and Ga\u00ebtan Leurent discovered that 64-bit block\nciphers are vulnerable to a birthday attack. A remote attacker could\npossibly use this issue to recover cleartext data. Fixing this issue\nrequires a configuration change to switch to a different cipher. This\nupdate adds a warning to the log file when a 64-bit block cipher is in use.\nThis issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and\nUbuntu 16.10. (CVE-2016-6329)\n\nIt was discovered that OpenVPN incorrectly handled rollover of packet ids.\nAn authenticated remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenVPN to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu\n14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.10. (CVE-2017-7479)\n\nGuido Vranken discovered that OpenVPN incorrectly handled certain malformed\nIPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenVPN to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2017-7508)\n\nGuido Vranken discovered that OpenVPN incorrectly handled an HTTP proxy\nwith NTLM authentication. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause\nOpenVPN clients to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly\nexpose sensitive memory contents. (CVE-2017-7520)\n\nGuido Vranken discovered that OpenVPN incorrectly handled certain x509\nextensions. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenVPN to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2017-7521)\n\n",
