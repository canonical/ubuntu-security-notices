  "summary": "linux-intel-iotg vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the Traffic-Control Index (TCINDEX) implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not properly perform filter deactivation in some\nsituations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated\nprivileges. Please note that with the fix for this CVE, kernel support for\nthe TCINDEX classifier has been removed. (CVE-2023-1829)\n\nIt was discovered that some AMD x86-64 processors with SMT enabled could\nspeculatively execute instructions using a return address from a sibling\nthread. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2022-27672)\n\nZheng Wang discovered that the Intel i915 graphics driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a\ndouble-free. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2022-3707)\n\nJordy Zomer and Alexandra Sandulescu discovered that the Linux kernel did\nnot properly implement speculative execution barriers in usercopy functions\nin certain situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-0459)\n\nIt was discovered that the TLS subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a\ntype confusion vulnerability in some situations. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2023-1075)\n\nIt was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol\nimplementation in the Linux kernel contained a type confusion vulnerability\nin some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2023-1078)\n\nXingyuan Mo discovered that the x86 KVM implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly initialize some data structures. A local attacker could\nuse this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-1513)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the io_uring subsystem\nin the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-1872)\n\nIt was discovered that the Android Binder IPC subsystem in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate inputs in some situations, leading to a use-\nafter-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-20938)\n\nIt was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the iSCSI\nTCP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-2162)\n\nIt was discovered that the NET/ROM protocol implementation in the Linux\nkernel contained a race condition in some situations, leading to a use-\nafter-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-32269)\n\nDuoming Zhou discovered that a race condition existed in the infrared\nreceiver/transceiver driver in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-\nfree vulnerability. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2023-1118)\n\n",
