  "details": "It was discovered that the Go net/http module incorrectly handled\nTransfer-Encoding headers in the HTTP/1 client. A remote attacker could\npossibly use this issue to perform an HTTP Request Smuggling attack.\n(CVE-2022-1705)\n\nIt was discovered that Go did not properly manage memory under certain\ncircumstances. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a panic\nresulting into a denial of service. (CVE-2022-1962, CVE-2022-27664,\nCVE-2022-28131, CVE-2022-30630, CVE-2022-30631, CVE-2022-30632,\nCVE-2022-30633, CVE-2022-30635, CVE-2022-32189, CVE-2022-41715,\nCVE-2022-41717, CVE-2023-24534, CVE-2023-24537)\n\nIt was discovered that Go did not properly implemented the maximum size of\nfile headers in Reader.Read. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\ncause a panic resulting into a denial of service. (CVE-2022-2879)\n\nIt was discovered that the Go net/http module incorrectly handled query\nparameters in requests forwarded by ReverseProxy. A remote attacker could\npossibly use this issue to perform an HTTP Query Parameter Smuggling attack.\n(CVE-2022-2880)\n\nIt was discovered that Go did not properly manage the permissions for\nFaccessat function. A attacker could possibly use this issue to expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2022-29526)\n\nIt was discovered that Go did not properly generate the values for\nticket_age_add in session tickets. An attacker could possibly use this\nissue to observe TLS handshakes to correlate successive connections by\ncomparing ticket ages during session resumption. (CVE-2022-30629)\n\nIt was discovered that Go did not properly manage client IP addresses in\nnet/http. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause ReverseProxy\nto set the client IP as the value of the X-Forwarded-For header.\n(CVE-2022-32148)\n\nIt was discovered that Go did not properly validate backticks (`) as\nJavascript string delimiters, and do not escape them as expected. An\nattacker could possibly use this issue to inject arbitrary Javascript code\ninto the Go template. (CVE-2023-24538)\n",
