  "details": "USN 4115-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux 4.15 kernel for Ubuntu\n18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Unfortunately, as part of the update,\na regression was introduced that caused a kernel crash when handling\nfragmented packets in some situations. This update addresses the issue.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the Option USB High Speed driver\n in the Linux kernel did not properly validate metadata received from the\n device. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of\n service (system crash). (CVE-2018-19985)\n\n Zhipeng Xie discovered that an infinite loop could triggered in the CFS\n Linux kernel process scheduler. A local attacker could possibly use this to\n cause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-20784)\n\n It was discovered that the Intel Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux kernel did\n not properly validate certain Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS). A\n physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n (Wi-Fi disconnect). (CVE-2019-0136)\n\n It was discovered that the Bluetooth UART implementation in the Linux\n kernel did not properly check for missing tty operations. A local attacker\n could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-10207)\n\n Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the Linux kernel did not\n sufficiently randomize IP ID values generated for connectionless networking\n protocols. A remote attacker could use this to track particular Linux\n devices. (CVE-2019-10638)\n\n Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the location of kernel\n addresses could be exposed by the implementation of connection-less network\n protocols in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could possibly use this to\n assist in the exploitation of another vulnerability in the Linux kernel.\n (CVE-2019-10639)\n\n It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the Linux kernel when\n reference counting pages, leading to potential use-after-free issues. A\n local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)\n or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-11487)\n\n Jann Horn discovered that a race condition existed in the Linux kernel when\n performing core dumps. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\n service (system crash) or expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-11599)\n\n It was discovered that a null pointer dereference vulnerability existed in\n the LSI Logic MegaRAID driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could\n use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-11810)\n\n It was discovered that the GTCO tablet input driver in the Linux kernel did\n not properly bounds check the initial HID report sent by the device. A\n physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-13631)\n\n Praveen Pandey discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly validate\n sent signals in some situations on PowerPC systems with transactional\n memory disabled. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\n service. (CVE-2019-13648)\n\n It was discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not\n properly validate meta data, leading to a buffer overread. A local attacker\n could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n (CVE-2019-14283)\n\n It was discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not\n properly validate ioctl() calls, leading to a division-by-zero. A local\n attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n (CVE-2019-14284)\n\n Tuba Yavuz discovered that a race condition existed in the DesignWare USB3\n DRD Controller device driver in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate\n attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-14763)\n\n It was discovered that an out-of-bounds read existed in the QLogic QEDI\n iSCSI Initiator Driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly\n use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-15090)\n\n It was discovered that the Raremono AM/FM/SW radio device driver in the\n Linux kernel did not properly allocate memory, leading to a use-after-free.\n A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-15211)\n\n It was discovered at a double-free error existed in the USB Rio 500 device\n driver for the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this\n to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-15212)\n\n It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced Linux Sound\n Architecture (ALSA) subsystem of the Linux kernel, leading to a potential\n use-after-free. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a\n denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n (CVE-2019-15214)\n\n It was discovered that a race condition existed in the CPiA2 video4linux\n device driver for the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free. A\n physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-15215)\n\n It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Softmac USB Prism54\n device driver in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could\n use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15220)\n\n It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the\n AppleTalk implementation in the Linux kernel if an error occurs during\n initialization. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of\n service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15292)\n\n Jason Wang discovered that an infinite loop vulnerability existed in the\n virtio net driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker in a guest VM could\n possibly use this to cause a denial of service in the host system.\n (CVE-2019-3900)\n\n Daniele Antonioli, Nils Ole Tippenhauer, and Kasper B. Rasmussen discovered\n that the Bluetooth protocol BR/EDR specification did not properly require\n sufficiently strong encryption key lengths. A physically proximate attacker\n could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-9506)\n\n It was discovered that a race condition existed in the USB YUREX device\n driver in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this\n to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15216)\n\n It was discovered that the Siano USB MDTV receiver device driver in the\n Linux kernel made improper assumptions about the device characteristics. A\n physically proximate attacker could use this cause a denial of service\n (system crash). (CVE-2019-15218)\n\n It was discovered that the Line 6 POD USB device driver in the Linux kernel\n did not properly validate data size information from the device. A\n physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n (system crash). (CVE-2019-15221)\n\n Muyu Yu discovered that the CAN implementation in the Linux kernel in some\n situations did not properly restrict the field size when processing\n outgoing frames. A local attacker with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges could use\n this to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-3701)\n\n Vladis Dronov discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's\n HID subsystem did not properly validate passed parameters in some\n situations. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of\n service (infinite loop). (CVE-2019-3819)\n",
