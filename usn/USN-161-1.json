  "description": "USN-158-1 fixed a command injection vulnerability in the \"zgrep\"\nutility. It was determined that the \"bzgrep\" counterpart in the bzip2\npackage is vulnerable to the same flaw.\n\nbzgrep did not handle shell metacharacters like '|' and '&' properly\nwhen they occurred in input file names. This could be exploited to\nexecute arbitrary commands with user privileges if bzgrep was run in\nan untrusted directory with specially crafted file names.",
