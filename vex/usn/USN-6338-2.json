                "description": "Zi Fan Tan discovered that the binder IPC implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-21255)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the f2fs file system in the Linux kernel, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious f2fs image that, when mounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-2898)  It was discovered that the DVB Core driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle locking events in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). (CVE-2023-31084)  Quentin Minster discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle session setup requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2023-32247)  Quentin Minster discovered that a race condition existed in the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel when handling sessions operations. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-32250, CVE-2023-32252, CVE-2023-32257)  It was discovered that a race condition existed in the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel when handling session connections, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-32258)  It was discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate buffer sizes in certain operations, leading to an out-of- bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-38426, CVE-2023-38428)  It was discovered that the KSMBD implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly calculate the size of certain buffers. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-38429)",
