  "details": "An issue was discovered in Blink involving the provisional URL for an\ninitially empty document. An attacker could potentially exploit this to\nspoof the currently displayed URL. (CVE-2016-5141)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in the WebCrypto implementation in Blink.\nIf a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an\nattacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via\napplication crash, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5142)\n\nIt was discovered that the devtools subsystem in Blink mishandles various\nparameters. An attacker could exploit this to bypass intended access\nrestrictions. (CVE-2016-5143, CVE-2016-5144)\n\nIt was discovered that Blink does not ensure that a taint property is\npreserved after a structure-clone operation on an ImageBitmap object\nderived from a cross-origin image. If a user were tricked in to opening a\nspecially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\nbypass same origin restrictions. (CVE-2016-5145)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial\nof service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2016-5146, CVE-2016-5167)\n\nIt was discovered that Blink mishandles deferred page loads. If a user\nwere tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n(CVE-2016-5147)\n\nAn issue was discovered in Blink related to widget updates. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n(CVE-2016-5148)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5150)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5153)\n\nIt was discovered that Chromium does not correctly validate access to the\ninitial document. An attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the\ncurrently displayed URL. (CVE-2016-5155)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in the event bindings in Blink. If a user\nwere tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application\ncrash, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5156)\n\nA type confusion bug was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5161)\n\nAn issue was discovered with the devtools implementation. An attacker\ncould potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)\nattacks. (CVE-2016-5164)\n\nAn issue was discovered with the devtools implementation. An attacker\ncould potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)\nattacks. (CVE-2016-5165)\n",
