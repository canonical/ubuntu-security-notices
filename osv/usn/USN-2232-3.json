  "details": "USN-2232-1 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenSSL. The upstream fix for\nCVE-2014-0224 caused a regression for certain applications that use\nrenegotiation, such as PostgreSQL. This update fixes the problem.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n J\u00fcri Aedla discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled invalid DTLS\n fragments. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to\n crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary\n code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 13.10, and\n Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2014-0195)\n \n Imre Rad discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled DTLS recursions. A\n remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting\n in a denial of service. (CVE-2014-0221)\n \n KIKUCHI Masashi discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain\n handshakes. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform a\n machine-in-the-middle attack and possibly decrypt and modify traffic.\n (CVE-2014-0224)\n \n Felix Gr\u00f6bert and Ivan Fratri\u0107 discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled\n anonymous ECDH ciphersuites. A remote attacker could use this issue to\n cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only\n affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 13.10, and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\n (CVE-2014-3470)\n",
