                "description": "USN-3366-1 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenJDK 8. Unfortunately, that update introduced a regression that caused some valid JAR files to fail validation. This update fixes the problem.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Original advisory details:   It was discovered that the JPEGImageReader class in OpenJDK would  incorrectly read unused image data. An attacker could use this to  specially construct a jpeg image file that when opened by a Java  application would cause a denial of service. (CVE-2017-10053)   It was discovered that the JAR verifier in OpenJDK did not properly  handle archives containing files missing digests. An attacker could  use this to modify the signed contents of a JAR file. (CVE-2017-10067)   It was discovered that integer overflows existed in the Hotspot  component of OpenJDK when generating range check loop predicates. An  attacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted Java  application or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions  and cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary  code. (CVE-2017-10074)   It was discovered that the JavaScript Scripting component of OpenJDK  incorrectly allowed access to Java APIs. An attacker could use this  to specially craft JavaScript code to bypass access restrictions.  (CVE-2017-10078)   It was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly process parentheses  in function signatures. An attacker could use this to specially  construct an untrusted Java application or applet that could escape  sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2017-10081)   It was discovered that the ThreadPoolExecutor class in OpenJDK did not  properly perform access control checks when cleaning up threads. An  attacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted Java  application or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions and  possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-10087)   It was discovered that the ServiceRegistry implementation  in OpenJDK did not perform access control checks in certain  situations. An attacker could use this to specially construct  an untrusted Java application or applet that escaped sandbox  restrictions. (CVE-2017-10089)   It was discovered that the channel groups implementation in  OpenJDK did not properly perform access control checks in some  situations. An attacker could use this to specially construct an  untrusted Java application or applet that could escape sandbox  restrictions. (CVE-2017-10090)   It was discovered that the DTM exception handling code in the  JAXP component of OpenJDK did not properly perform access control  checks. An attacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted  Java application or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions.  (CVE-2017-10096)   It was discovered that the JAXP component of OpenJDK incorrectly  granted access to some internal resolvers. An attacker could use this  to specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet that  could escape sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2017-10101)   It was discovered that the Distributed Garbage Collector (DGC) in  OpenJDK did not properly track references in some situations. A  remote attacker could possibly use this to execute arbitrary  code. (CVE-2017-10102)   It was discovered that the Activation ID implementation in the RMI  component of OpenJDK did not properly check access control permissions  in some situations. An attacker could use this to specially construct  an untrusted Java application or applet that could escape sandbox  restrictions. (CVE-2017-10107)   It was discovered that the BasicAttribute class in OpenJDK did not  properly bound memory allocation when de-serializing objects. An  attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory  consumption). (CVE-2017-10108)   It was discovered that the CodeSource class in OpenJDK did not  properly bound memory allocations when de-serializing object  instances. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service  (memory consumption). (CVE-2017-10109)   It was discovered that the AWT ImageWatched class in OpenJDK did not  properly perform access control checks, An attacker could use this  to specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet that  could escape sandbox restrictions (CVE-2017-10110)   Jackson Davis discovered that the LambdaFormEditor class in the  Libraries component of OpenJDK did not correctly perform bounds checks  in the permuteArgumentsForm() function. An attacker could use this  to specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet that  could escape sandbox restrictions and possibly execute arbitrary  code. (CVE-2017-10111)   It was discovered that a timing side-channel vulnerability existed  in the DSA implementation in OpenJDK. An attacker could use this to  expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-10115)   It was discovered that the LDAP implementation in OpenJDK incorrectly  followed references to non-LDAP URLs. An attacker could use this to  specially craft an LDAP referral URL that exposes sensitive information  or bypass access restrictions. (CVE-2017-10116)   It was discovered that a timing side-channel vulnerability existed  in the ECDSA implementation in OpenJDK. An attacker could use this  to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-10118)   Ilya Maykov discovered that a timing side-channel vulnerability  existed in the PKCS#8 implementation in OpenJDK. An attacker could  use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-10135)   It was discovered that the Elliptic Curve (EC) implementation  in OpenJDK did not properly compute certain elliptic curve  points. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive  information. (CVE-2017-10176)   It was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly restrict weak key  sizes in some situations. An attacker could use this to specially  construct an untrusted Java application or applet that could escape  sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2017-10193)   It was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly enforce disabled  algorithm restrictions on X.509 certificate chains. An attacker  could use this to expose sensitive information or escape sandbox  restrictions. (CVE-2017-10198)   It was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly perform access control  checks when handling Web Service Definition Language (WSDL) XML  documents. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.  (CVE-2017-10243)",
