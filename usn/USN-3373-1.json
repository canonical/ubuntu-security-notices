  "description": "Emmanuel Dreyfus discovered that third-party modules using the\nap_get_basic_auth_pw() function outside of the authentication phase may\nlead to authentication requirements being bypassed. This update adds a new\nap_get_basic_auth_components() function for use by third-party modules.\n(CVE-2017-3167)\n\nVasileios Panopoulos discovered that the Apache mod_ssl module may crash\nwhen third-party modules call ap_hook_process_connection() during an HTTP\nrequest to an HTTPS port. (CVE-2017-3169)\n\nJavier Jim\u00e9nez discovered that the Apache HTTP Server incorrectly handled\nparsing certain requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue\nto cause the Apache HTTP Server to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n(CVE-2017-7668)\n\nChenQin and Hanno B\u00f6ck discovered that the Apache mod_mime module\nincorrectly handled certain Content-Type response headers. A remote\nattacker could possibly use this issue to cause the Apache HTTP Server to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2017-7679)\n\nDavid Dennerline and R\u00e9gis Leroy discovered that the Apache HTTP Server\nincorrectly handled unusual whitespace when parsing requests, contrary to\nspecifications. When being used in combination with a proxy or backend\nserver, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform an\ninjection attack and pollute cache. This update may introduce compatibility\nissues with clients that do not strictly follow HTTP protocol\nspecifications. A new configuration option \"HttpProtocolOptions Unsafe\" can\nbe used to revert to the previous unsafe behaviour in problematic\nenvironments. (CVE-2016-8743)\n",
