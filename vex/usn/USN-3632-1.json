                "description": "It was discovered that a race condition leading to a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the ALSA PCM subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-0861)  It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel allowed passthrough of the diagnostic I/O port 0x80. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS. (CVE-2017-1000407)  It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the network namespaces implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-15129)  It was discovered that the HugeTLB component of the Linux kernel did not properly handle holes in hugetlb ranges. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2017-16994)  It was discovered that the netfilter component of the Linux did not properly restrict access to the connection tracking helpers list. A local attacker could use this to bypass intended access restrictions. (CVE-2017-17448)  It was discovered that the netfilter passive OS fingerprinting (xt_osf) module did not properly perform access control checks. A local attacker could improperly modify the system-wide OS fingerprint list. (CVE-2017-17450)  Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds read when handling memory-mapped I/O. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-17741)  It was discovered that the Salsa20 encryption algorithm implementations in the Linux kernel did not properly handle zero-length inputs. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2017-17805)  It was discovered that the HMAC implementation did not validate the state of the underlying cryptographic hash algorithm. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-17806)  It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check permissions when a key request was performed on a task's default keyring. A local attacker could use this to add keys to unauthorized keyrings. (CVE-2017-17807)  It was discovered that the Broadcom NetXtremeII ethernet driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate Generic Segment Offload (GSO) packet sizes. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (interface unavailability). (CVE-2018-1000026)  It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Socket (RDS) implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write during RDMA page allocation. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-5332)  Mohamed Ghannam discovered a null pointer dereference in the RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets) protocol implementation of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-5333)  \u8303\u9f99\u98de discovered that a race condition existed in loop block device implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-5344)  It was discovered that the Broadcom UniMAC MDIO bus controller driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device resources. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-8043)",
