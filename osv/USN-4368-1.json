  "details": "Tristan Madani discovered that the file locking implementation in the Linux\nkernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could possibly use this\nto cause a denial of service or expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2019-19769)\n\nIt was discovered that the Serial CAN interface driver in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly initialize data. A local attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-11494)\n\nIt was discovered that the linux kernel did not properly validate certain\nmount options to the tmpfs virtual memory file system. A local attacker\nwith the ability to specify mount options could use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash). (CVE-2020-11565)\n\nIt was discovered that the OV51x USB Camera device driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2020-11608)\n\nIt was discovered that the STV06XX USB Camera device driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2020-11609)\n\nIt was discovered that the Xirlink C-It USB Camera device driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically\nproximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2020-11668)\n\nDavid Gibson discovered that the Linux kernel on Power9 CPUs did not\nproperly save and restore Authority Mask registers state in some\nsituations. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial\nof service (host system crash). (CVE-2020-11669)\n\nIt was discovered that the block layer in the Linux kernel contained a race\ncondition leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could\npossibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2020-12657)\n",
