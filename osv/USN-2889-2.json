  "details": "It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the\nAF_UNIX implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use\ncrafted epoll_ctl calls to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\nexpose sensitive information. (CVE-2013-7446)\n\nIt was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly restore the values of the Programmable Interrupt Timer (PIT). A\nuser-assisted attacker in a KVM guest could cause a denial of service in\nthe host (system crash). (CVE-2015-7513)\n\nSasha Levin discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS)\nimplementation in the Linux kernel had a race condition when checking\nwhether a socket was bound or not. A local attacker could use this to cause\na denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-7990)\n\nIt was discovered that the Btrfs implementation in the Linux kernel\nincorrectly handled compressed inline extants on truncation. A local\nattacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2015-8374)\n\nIt was discovered that the netfilter Network Address Translation (NAT)\nimplementation did not ensure that data structures were initialized when\nhandling IPv4 addresses. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2015-8787)\n",
