  "details": "USN-4227-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu\n18.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the\nLinux kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.\n\nIt was discovered that a heap-based buffer overflow existed in the Marvell\nWiFi-Ex Driver for the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2019-14895, CVE-2019-14901)\n\nIt was discovered that a heap-based buffer overflow existed in the Marvell\nLibertas WLAN Driver for the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-14896, CVE-2019-14897)\n\nIt was discovered that the Fujitsu ES network device driver for the Linux\nkernel did not properly check for errors in some situations, leading to a\nNULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service. (CVE-2019-16231)\n\nIt was discovered that the QLogic Fibre Channel driver in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly check for error, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. A\nlocal attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2019-16233)\n\nAnthony Steinhauser discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly\nperform Spectre_RSB mitigations to all processors for PowerPC architecture\nsystems in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2019-18660)\n\nIt was discovered that the Mellanox Technologies Innova driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain failure conditions. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory\nexhaustion). (CVE-2019-19045)\n\nIt was discovered that Geschwister Schneider USB CAN interface driver in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain failure\nconditions. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19052)\n\nIt was discovered that the AMD Display Engine Driver in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local\nattack could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2019-19083)\n\nIt was discovered that the driver for memoryless force-feedback input\ndevices in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nphysically proximate attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-19524)\n\nIt was discovered that the Microchip CAN BUS Analyzer driver in the Linux\nkernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability on device disconnect. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-19529)\n\nIt was discovered that the PEAK-System Technik USB driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly sanitize memory before sending it to the device. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-19534)\n\nTristan Madani discovered that the ALSA timer implementation in the Linux\nkernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2019-19807)\n",
