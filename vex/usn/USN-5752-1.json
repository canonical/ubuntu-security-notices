                "description": "David Bouman and Billy Jheng Bing Jhong discovered that a race condition existed in the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a use- after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2602)  S\u00f6nke Huster discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel, leading to a buffer overflow. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-41674)  S\u00f6nke Huster discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-42719)  S\u00f6nke Huster discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-42720)  S\u00f6nke Huster discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel did not properly handle BSSID/SSID lists in some situations. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (infinite loop). (CVE-2022-42721)  S\u00f6nke Huster discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel contained a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in certain situations. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-42722)",
