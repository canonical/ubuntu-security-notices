  "details": "Al Viro discovered that the Linux kernel for s390x systems did not properly\nperform page table upgrades for kernel sections that use secondary address\nmode. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-11884)\n\nIt was discovered that the Intel Wi-Fi driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly check for errors in some situations. A local attacker could\npossibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2019-16234)\n\nTristan Madani discovered that the block I/O tracing implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2019-19768)\n\nIt was discovered that the vhost net driver in the Linux kernel contained a\nstack buffer overflow. A local attacker with the ability to perform ioctl()\ncalls on /dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2020-10942)\n\nIt was discovered that the virtual terminal implementation in the Linux\nkernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could possibly use this\nto cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2020-8648)\n\nShijie Luo discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly check for a too-large journal size. An attacker\ncould use this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted,\ncould cause a denial of service (soft lockup). (CVE-2020-8992)\n\nJordy Zomer discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly check for errors in some situations. A local attacker could\npossibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexpose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-9383)\n",
