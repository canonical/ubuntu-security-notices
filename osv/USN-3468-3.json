  "details": "It was discovered that the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly bound guest IRQs. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to\ncause a denial of service (host system crash). (CVE-2017-1000252)\n\nIt was discovered that the Flash-Friendly File System (f2fs) implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not properly validate superblock metadata. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-10663)\n\nAnthony Perard discovered that the Xen virtual block driver did not\nproperly initialize some data structures before passing them to user space.\nA local attacker in a guest VM could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation from the host OS or other guest VMs. (CVE-2017-10911)\n\nIt was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the POSIX\nmessage queue implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2017-11176)\n\nDave Chinner discovered that the XFS filesystem did not enforce that the\nrealtime inode flag was settable only on filesystems on a realtime device.\nA local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash).
