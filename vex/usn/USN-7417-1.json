(CVE-2016-1249)  It was discovered that libdbd-mysql-perl did not correctly handle certain memory operations, which could lead to a use-after-free vulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-1251, CVE-2017-10788)  It was discovered that libdbd-mysql-perl did not properly enforce SSL connections depending on the mysql_ssl setting. A machine-in-the-middle attacker could possibly use this issue to spoof servers. (CVE-2017-10789)",
