  "details": "A missing permission check when settings ACLs was discovered in nfsd. A\nlocal user could exploit this flaw to gain access to any file by setting an\nACL. (CVE-2016-1237)\n\nKangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the Reliable Datagram Sockets\n(RDS) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this\nto obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.\n(CVE-2016-5244)\n\nJames Patrick-Evans discovered that the airspy USB device driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions. An attacker\nwith physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (memory\nconsumption). (CVE-2016-5400)\n\nYue Cao et al discovered a flaw in the TCP implementation's handling of\nchallenge acks in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (reset connection) or inject content into an TCP\nstream. (CVE-2016-5696)\n\nPengfei Wang discovered a race condition in the MIC VOP driver in the Linux\nkernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel\nmemory. (CVE-2016-5728)\n\nCyril Bur discovered that on PowerPC platforms, the Linux kernel mishandled\ntransactional memory state on exec(). A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2016-5828)\n\nIt was discovered that a heap based buffer overflow existed in the USB HID\ndriver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2016-5829)\n\nIt was discovered that the OverlayFS implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly verify dentry state before proceeding with unlink and rename\noperations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2016-6197)\n",
