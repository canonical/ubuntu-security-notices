  "details": "USN-3676-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04\nLTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux\nHardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu\n14.04 LTS.\n\nWen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle corrupted meta data in some situations. An\nattacker could use this to specially craft an ext4 file system that caused\na denial of service (system crash) when mounted. (CVE-2018-1092,\nCVE-2018-1093)\n\nIt was discovered that the cdrom driver in the Linux kernel contained an\nincorrect bounds check. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation (kernel memory). (CVE-2018-10940)\n\nIt was discovered that the 802.11 software simulator implementation in the\nLinux kernel contained a memory leak when handling certain error\nconditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of\nservice (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2018-8087)\n",
