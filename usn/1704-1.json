  "description": "\nBrad Spengler discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's uname system call. An\nunprivileged user could exploit this flaw to read kernel stack memory.\n(CVE-2012-0957)\n\nJon Howell reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel-based virtual\nmachine) subsystem's handling of the XSAVE feature. On hosts, using qemu\nuserspace, without the XSAVE feature an unprivileged local attacker could\nexploit this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2012-4461)\n\nDmitry Monakhov reported a race condition flaw the Linux ext4 filesystem\nthat can expose stale data. An unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to\ncause an information leak. (CVE-2012-4508)\n\nA flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's handling of script execution\nwhen module loading is enabled. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to\ncause a leak of kernel stack contents. (CVE-2012-4530)\n\nRodrigo Freire discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's TCP illinois\ncongestion control algorithm. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2012-4565)\n\nA flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's handling of new hot-plugged\nmemory. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a\ndenial of service by crashing the system. (CVE-2012-5517)\n\nFlorian Weimer discovered that hypervkvpd, which is distributed in the\nLinux kernel, was not correctly validating source addresses of netlink\npackets. An untrusted local user can cause a denial of service by causing\nhypervkvpd to exit. (CVE-2012-5532)\n\nAn information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's /dev/dvb device. A\nlocal user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from the\nkernel's stack memory. (CVE-2013-1928)\n",
