  "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability has been discovered in the XMLRPC module\nof the PEAR (PHP Extension and Application Repository) extension of PHP. By\nsending specially crafted XMLRPC requests to an affected web server, a remote\nattacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the web server's\nprivileges.\n\nIn Ubuntu 5.04 (Hoary Hedgehog), the PEAR extension is unsupported (it is\ncontained in the php4-universe package which is part of universe). However,\nsince this is a highly critical vulnerability, that package was fixed as well.\n\nPlease note that many applications contain a copy of the affected XMLRPC code,\nwhich must be fixed separately. The following packages may also be affected,\nbut are unsupported in Ubuntu:\n\n - drupal\n - wordpress\n - phpwiki\n - horde3\n - ewiki\n - egroupware\n - phpgroupware\n\nThese packages might be fixed by the community later.\n\nThe following common third party applications are affected as well, but not packaged\nfor Ubuntu:\n\n - Serendipity\n - Postnuke\n - tikiwiki\n - phpwebsite\n\nIf you run any affected software, please upgrade them as soon as possible to\nprotect your server.",
