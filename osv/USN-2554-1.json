A local\nattacker could use this attack to possibly recover private keys.\n(CVE-2014-3591)\n\nDaniel Genkin, Adi Shamir, and Eran Tromer discovered that GnuPG was\nsusceptible to an attack via physical side channels. A local attacker could\nuse this attack to possibly recover private keys. (CVE-2015-0837)\n\nHanno B\u00f6ck discovered that GnuPG incorrectly handled certain malformed\nkeyrings. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a\nmalformed keyring, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause GnuPG to\ncrash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2015-1606, CVE-2015-1607)\n\nIn addition, this update improves GnuPG security by validating that the\nkeys returned by keyservers match those requested.\n",
