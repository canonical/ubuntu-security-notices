                "description": "USN-4734-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in wpa_supplicant. This update provides the corresponding update for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.  It was discovered that wpa_supplicant did not properly handle P2P (Wi-Fi Direct) group information in some situations, leading to a heap overflow. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-0326)  It was discovered that hostapd did not properly handle UPnP subscribe messages in some circumstances. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-12695)",
