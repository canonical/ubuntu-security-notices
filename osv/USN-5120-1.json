  "summary": "linux-azure-5.8 vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the f2fs file system in the Linux kernel did not\nproperly validate metadata in some situations. An attacker could use this\nto construct a malicious f2fs image that, when mounted and operated on,\ncould cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2019-19449)\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly enforce certain\ntypes of entries in the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (aka dbx)\nprotection mechanism. An attacker could use this to bypass UEFI Secure Boot\nrestrictions. (CVE-2020-26541)\n\nIt was discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation for AMD processors\nin the Linux kernel did not ensure enough processing time was given to\nperform cleanups of large SEV VMs. A local attacker could use this to cause\na denial of service (soft lockup). (CVE-2020-36311)\n\nIt was discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations,\nleading to a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker who could start and\ncontrol a VM could possibly use this to expose sensitive information or\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-22543)\n\nMurray McAllister discovered that the joystick device interface in the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate data passed via an ioctl(). A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code on systems with a joystick device\nregistered. (CVE-2021-3612)\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly account for the\nmemory usage of certain IPC objects. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-3759)\n\nMichael Wakabayashi discovered that the NFSv4 client implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly order connection setup operations. An\nattacker controlling a remote NFS server could use this to cause a denial\nof service on the client. (CVE-2021-38199)\n\nIt was discovered that the Xilinx LL TEMAC device driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly calculate the number of buffers to be used in\ncertain situations. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2021-38207)\n\nIt was discovered that the ext4 file system in the Linux kernel contained a\nrace condition when writing xattrs to an inode. A local attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service or possibly gain administrative\nprivileges. (CVE-2021-40490)\n",
