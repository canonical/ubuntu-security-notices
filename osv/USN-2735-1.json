  "details": "It was discovered that the DOM tree could be corrupted during parsing in\nsome circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially\ncrafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass\nsame-origin restrictions or cause a denial of service. (CVE-2015-1291)\n\nAn issue was discovered in NavigatorServiceWorker::serviceWorker in Blink.\nIf a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an\nattacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin\nrestrictions. (CVE-2015-1292)\n\nAn issue was discovered in the DOM implementation in Blink. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions.\n(CVE-2015-1293)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1294)\n\nA use-after-free was discovered in the shared-timer implementation in\nBlink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,\nan attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service\nvia renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nsandboxed render process. (CVE-2015-1299)\n\nIt was discovered that the availability of iframe Resource Timing API\ntimes was not properly restricted in some circumstances. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2015-1300)\n\nMultiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial\nof service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2015-1301)\n\nA heap corruption issue was discovered in oxide::JavaScriptDialogManager.\nIf a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an\nattacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via\napplication crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nuser invoking the program.
