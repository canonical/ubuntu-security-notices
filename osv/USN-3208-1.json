  "summary": "linux, linux-snapdragon vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the generic SCSI block layer in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly restrict write operations in certain situations. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2016-10088)\n\nCAI Qian discovered that the sysctl implementation in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly perform reference counting in some situations. An unprivileged\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system hang).\n(CVE-2016-9191)\n\nJim Mattson discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel\nmismanages the #BP and #OF exceptions. A local attacker in a guest virtual\nmachine could use this to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash).\n(CVE-2016-9588)\n\nAndy Lutomirski and Willy Tarreau discovered that the KVM implementation in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly emulate instructions on the SS segment\nregister. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to\ncause a denial of service (guest OS crash) or possibly gain administrative\nprivileges in the guest OS. (CVE-2017-2583)\n\nDmitry Vyukov discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel\nimproperly emulated certain instructions. A local attacker could use this\nto obtain sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2017-2584)\n\nIt was discovered that the KLSI KL5KUSB105 serial-to-USB device driver in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory related to logging. A\nlocal attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel\nmemory). (CVE-2017-5549)\n\nAndrey Konovalov discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the DCCP\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain administrative\nprivileges. (CVE-2017-6074)\n",
