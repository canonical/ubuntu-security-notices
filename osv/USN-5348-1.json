(CVE-2021-21408)\n\nIt was discovered that Smarty was incorrectly managing access control to\ntemplate objects, which allowed users to perform a sandbox escape. An\nattacker could possibly use this issue to send specially crafted input to\napplications that use Smarty and execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-26119)\n\nIt was discovered that Smarty was not checking for special characters\nwhen setting function names during plugin compile operations. An attacker\ncould possibly use this issue to send specially crafted input to\napplications that use Smarty and execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-26120)\n\nIt was discovered that Smarty was incorrectly sanitizing characters in\nmath strings processed by the math function. An attacker could possibly\nuse this issue to send specially crafted input to applications that use\nSmarty and execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-29454)\n",
