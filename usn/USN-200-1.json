  "description": "A buffer overflow was discovered in the XBM image handler. By tricking\nan user into opening a specially crafted XBM image, an attacker could\nexploit this to execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges.\n(CAN-2005-2701)\n\nMats Palmgren discovered a buffer overflow in the Unicode string\nparser. Unicode strings that contained \"zero-width non-joiner\"\ncharacters caused a browser crash, which could possibly even exploited\nto execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges.\n(CAN-2005-2702)\n\nGeorgi Guninski reported an integer overflow in the JavaScript engine.\nThis could be exploited to run arbitrary code under some conditions.\n(CAN-2005-2705)\n\nPeter Zelezny discovered that URLs which are passed to Thunderbird on the\ncommand line are not correctly protected against interpretation by the shell.\nIf Thunderbird is configured as the default handler for \"mailto:\" URLs, this\ncould be exploited to execute arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking\nthe user into clicking on a specially crafted URL (for example, in an email or\nchat client).  (CAN-2005-2968)\n\nThis update also fixes some less critical issues which are described\nat http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/mfsa2005-58.html.\n(CAN-2005-2703, CAN-2005-2704, CAN-2005-2706, CAN-2005-2707)\n\nThe \"enigmail\" plugin has been updated to work with the new\nThunderbird and Mozilla versions.",
