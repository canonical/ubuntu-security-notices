  "details": "Christian Holler, David Major, Jesse Ruderman, Tyson Smith, Boris Zbarsky,\nRandell Jesup, Olli Pettay, Karl Tomlinson, Jeff Walden, Gary Kwong,\nAndrew McCreight, Georg Fritzsche, and Carsten Book discovered multiple\nmemory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a\nspecially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to\ncause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-4513,\nCVE-2015-4514)\n\nTim Brown discovered that Firefox discloses the hostname during NTLM\nauthentication in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website with NTLM v1 enabled, an attacker\ncould exploit this to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2015-4515)\n\nMario Heiderich and Frederik Braun discovered that CSP could be bypassed\nin reader mode in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening\na specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to\nconduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2015-4518)\n\nTyson Smith and David Keeler discovered a use-after-poison and buffer\noverflow in NSS. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\nwebsite, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of\nservice via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-7181, CVE-2015-7182)\n\nRyan Sleevi discovered an integer overflow in NSPR. If a user were tricked\nin to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\nexploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or\nexecute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.\n(CVE-2015-7183)\n\nJason Hamilton, Peter Arremann and Sylvain Giroux discovered that panels\ncreated via the Addon SDK with { script: false } could still execute\ninline script. If a user installed an addon that relied on this as a\nsecurity mechanism, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct\ncross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, depending on the source of the panel\ncontent. (CVE-2015-7187)\n\nMicha\u0142 Bentkowski discovered that adding white-space to hostnames that are\nIP address can bypass same-origin protections. If a user were tricked in\nto opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially\nexploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n(CVE-2015-7188)\n\nLooben Yang discovered a buffer overflow during script interactions with\nthe canvas element in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit\nthis to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.\n(CVE-2015-7189)\n\nShinto K Anto discovered that CORS preflight is bypassed when receiving\nnon-standard Content-Type headers in some circumstances. If a user were\ntricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could\npotentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions.\n(CVE-2015-7193)\n\nGustavo Grieco discovered a buffer overflow in libjar in some\ncircumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted\nwebsite, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of\nservice via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-7194)\n\nFrans Ros\u00e9n discovered that certain escaped characters in the Location\nheader are parsed incorrectly, resulting in a navigation to the previously\nparsed version of a URL. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially\ncrafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain site\nspecific tokens. (CVE-2015-7195)\n\nVytautas Staraitis discovered a garbage collection crash when interacting\nwith Java applets in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to\nopening a specially crafted website with the Java plugin installed, an\nattacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2015-7196)\n\nEhsan Akhgari discovered a mechanism for a web worker to bypass secure\nrequirements for web sockets. If a user were tricked in to opening a\nspecially crafted website, an attacker could exploit this to bypass the\nmixed content web socket policy. (CVE-2015-7197)\n\nRonald Crane discovered several vulnerabilities through code-inspection. If\na user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker\ncould potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via\napplication crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nuser invoking Firefox.
