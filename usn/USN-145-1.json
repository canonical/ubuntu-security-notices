  "description": "Jan Minar discovered a path traversal vulnerability in wget. If the\nname \"..\" was a valid host name (which can be achieved with a\nmalicious or poisoned domain name server), it was possible to trick\nwget into creating downloaded files into arbitrary locations with\narbitrary names. For example, wget could silently overwrite the users\n~/.bashrc and other configuration files which are executed\nautomatically. (CAN-2004-1487)\n\nJan Minar also discovered that wget printed HTTP response strings from\nthe server to the terminal without any filtering. Malicious HTTP\nservers could exploit this to send arbitrary terminal sequences and\nstrings which would then be executed and printed to the console. This\ncould potentially lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges\nof the user invoking wget. (CAN-2004-1488)\n\nHugo Vázquez Caramés discovered a race condition when writing output\nfiles. After wget determined the output file name, but before the file\nwas actually opened (the time window is determined by the delay of the\nfirst received data packet), a local attacker with with write\npermission to the download directory could create a symbolic link with\nthe name of the output file. This could be exploited to overwrite\narbitrary files with the permissions of the user invoking wget.\n(CAN-2004-2014)",
