  "description": "The object oriented scripting language Ruby supports safely executing\nuntrusted code with two mechanisms: safe level and taint flag on\nobjects. Dr. Yutaka Oiwa discovered a vulnerability that allows\nRuby methods to bypass these mechanisms. In systems which use this\nfeature, this could be exploited to execute Ruby code beyond the\nrestrictions specified in each safe level.",
