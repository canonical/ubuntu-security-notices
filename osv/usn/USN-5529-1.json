  "summary": "linux-oem-5.17 vulnerabilities",
  "details": "It was discovered that the Atheros ath9k wireless device driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly handle some error conditions, leading to a\nuse-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2022-1679)\n\nYongkang Jia discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle guest TLB mapping invalidation requests in\nsome situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) in the host OS. (CVE-2022-1789)\n\nQiuhao Li, Gaoning Pan, and Yongkang Jia discovered that the KVM hypervisor\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle an illegal\ninstruction in a guest, resulting in a null pointer dereference. An\nattacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) in the host OS. (CVE-2022-1852)\n\nGerald Lee discovered that the NTFS file system implementation in the Linux\nkernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a use-\nafter-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2022-1973)\n\nIt was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel\ncontained a buffer overflow in certain situations. A local attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2078)\n\nIt was discovered that some Intel processors did not completely perform\ncleanup actions on multi-core shared buffers. A local attacker could\npossibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21123)\n\nIt was discovered that some Intel processors did not completely perform\ncleanup actions on microarchitectural fill buffers. A local attacker could\npossibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21125)\n\nIt was discovered that some Intel processors did not properly perform\ncleanup during specific special register write operations. A local attacker\ncould possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-21166)\n\nIt was discovered that the virtio RPMSG bus driver in the Linux kernel\ncontained a double-free vulnerability in certain error conditions. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2022-34494, CVE-2022-34495)\n\nMinh Yuan discovered that the floppy disk driver in the Linux kernel\ncontained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nlocal attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1652)\n",
