  "details": "Thilo Uttendorfer discovered that the Samba LDAP server incorrectly handled\ncertain packets. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the LDAP\nserver to stop responding, resulting in a denial of service. This issue\nonly affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 15.04 and Ubuntu 15.10.\n(CVE-2015-3223)\n\nJan Kasprzak discovered that Samba incorrectly handled certain symlinks. A\nremote attacker could use this issue to access files outside the exported\nshare path. (CVE-2015-5252)\n\nStefan Metzmacher discovered that Samba did not enforce signing when\ncreating encrypted connections. If a remote attacker were able to perform a\nmachine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2015-5296)\n\nIt was discovered that Samba incorrectly performed access control when\nusing the VFS shadow_copy2 module. A remote attacker could use this issue\nto access snapshots, contrary to intended permissions. (CVE-2015-5299)\n\nDouglas Bagnall discovered that Samba incorrectly handled certain string\nlengths. A remote attacker could use this issue to possibly access\nsensitive information. (CVE-2015-5330)\n\nIt was discovered that the Samba LDAP server incorrectly handled certain\npackets. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the LDAP server to\nstop responding, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected\nUbuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 15.04 and Ubuntu 15.10. (CVE-2015-7540)\n\nAndrew Bartlett discovered that Samba incorrectly checked administrative\nprivileges during creation of machine accounts. A remote attacker could\npossibly use this issue to bypass intended access restrictions in certain\nenvironments. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 15.04 and\nUbuntu 15.10.
