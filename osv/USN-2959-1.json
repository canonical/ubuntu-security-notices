  "details": "Huzaifa Sidhpurwala, Hanno B\u00f6ck, and David Benjamin discovered that OpenSSL\nincorrectly handled memory when decoding ASN.1 structures. A remote\nattacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a\ndenial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2108)\n\nJuraj Somorovsky discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly performed padding when\nthe connection uses the AES CBC cipher and the server supports AES-NI. A\nremote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a padding oracle\nattack and decrypt traffic. (CVE-2016-2107)\n\nGuido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled large amounts of\ninput data to the EVP_EncodeUpdate() function. A remote attacker could use\nthis issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2105)\n\nGuido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled large amounts of\ninput data to the EVP_EncryptUpdate() function. A remote attacker could use\nthis issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2106)\n\nBrian Carpenter discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when\nASN.1 data is read from a BIO. A remote attacker could possibly use this\nissue to cause memory consumption, resulting in a denial of service.\n(CVE-2016-2109)\n\nAs a security improvement, this update also modifies OpenSSL behaviour to\nreject DH key sizes below 1024 bits, preventing a possible downgrade\nattack.\n",
